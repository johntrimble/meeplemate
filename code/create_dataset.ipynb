      "In Play: These are the cards on the table in front of you, showing your Race and Class (if any) and the Items you are carrying. Continuing Curses and some other cards also stay on the table after you play them. Cards in play are public information and must be visible to the other players.\n",
      "\n",
      "Conflicts Between Cards and Rules\n",
      "This rulesheet gives the general tules. Many cards add special rules, so in most cases when the rulesheet disagrees with a card, follow the card. However, ignore any card effect that might seem to contradict one of the rules listed below unless the card explicitly says it supersedes that rule!\n",
      "iL Nothing can reduce a player below Level 1, although card effects might reduce a player's or a monster's combat strength (p. 3) below I.\n",

      "3. You cannot collect rewards for defeating a monster (eg., Treasure, levels) in the middle of a combat. You must finish the fight before gaining any rewards.\n",
      "4. You must killa monster to reach Level 10, and you cannot force another player to help you do it.\n",
      "Any other disputes should be settled by loud arguments, with the owner of the game having the last word. You could also read the Munchkin FAQ and errata pages at munchkin.game, or start a discussion at forums.sjgames.com/, munchkin . . . unless it’s more fun to argue.\n",

      "Cards in play may not be returned to your hand - they must be discarded or traded if you want to get rid of them.\n",
      "\n",
      "CHARACTER CREATION\n",
      "Everyone starts as a Level | human with no class. (Heh, heh.) Munchkin characters may be either male or female. Your character's sex is the same as your own at the start of the game, unless you declare otherwise.\n",
      "Look at your initial eight cards. If you have any Race or Class cards, you may (if you like) play one of each type by placing it in front of you. If you have any usable Items (p. Bhs you may play them by placing them in front of you. If you have any doubt about whether you should play a card, you could read below, or you could just charge ahead and do it.\n",

      "You may perform these actions at any time, as long as you are not in combat: Trade an Item with another player (the other player may not be in combat, either).\n",

      "TURN PHASES\n",
      "Your turn begins as soon as the previous player's turn ends. When your cards are arranged the way you want, go to phase iL (1) Kick Open The Door: Draw one card from the Door deck and turn it face up.\n",

      "If you draw any other card, you may either put it in your hand or play it immediately.\n",
      "(2) Look For Trouble/Loot The Room: If you fought a monster in phase IL, skip this phase and go to phase Be If you did NOT draw a monster when you first opened the door, you have two choices: either Look For Trouble or Loot The Room.\n",
      "Look For Trouble: Play a monster from your hand and fight it, just as if you had found it when you kicked open the door. Don’t play a monster you can't handle, unless you're sure you can count on getting help (see p- 4)!\n",
      "Loot The Room: Draw a second card from the Door deck, face down, and place it in your hand.\n",
      "(3) Charity: If you have more than five cards in your hand, you must play enough cards to get you to five or below — for instance, you can play Curses, sell Items from your hand, or play Items to the table. If you cannot reduce your hand to five cards, or do not want to, you must give the excess cards to the player with the lowest Level. If players are tied for lowest, divide the cards as evenly as possible, but it's up to you who gets the bigger set(s) of leftovers. If YOU are the lowest or tied for lowest, just discard the excess.\n",
      "As soon as you are finished with Charity, the next player's turn begins.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ag\n",
      "\n",
      "Combat: Basic Rules\n",
      "When you fight a monster, you compare your combat strength (your Level plus any bonuses or penalties) against the monster's combat strength. If your combat strength is greater, you win! If it is tied or lower, the monster wins. For the full explanation, see Combat, p- 3.\n",
      "\n",
      "CHARACTER STATS\n",
      "Each character is basically a collection of weapons, armor, and magic items, with three stats: Level, Race, and Class. For instance, you might describe your character as a “Level 8 Elf Wizard with Boots of Butt-Kicking, a Staff of Napalm, and the Kneepads of Allure.” Level: This is a measure of how generally buff and studly you are. When the rules or cards refer to your Level, capitalized, they mean this number. You gain a level when you kill a monster, or when a card says that you do. You can also sell Items to buy levels (see Items). You lose a level when a card says you do. Your Level can never go below 1. However, your combat strength can be negative, if you get hit by a Curse or suffer some other kind of penalty.\n",
      "Class: Characters may be Warriors, Wizards, Thieves, or Clerics. If you have no Class card in front of you, you have no class. Yeah, I know, we did that one already.\n",
      "Each Class has special abilities, shown on the cards. You gain the abilities of a Class the moment you play its card in front of you, and lose them as soon as you discard that card. Some Class abilities are powered by discards. You may discard any card, in play or in your hand, to power a special ability.\n",
      "See the Class cards for when abilities can be used. Note that a Thief cannot steal while he or the target is fighting - and as soon as a monster is revealed, the fight is on!\n",
      "You can discard a Class card at any time, even in combat: “I don't wanna be a wizard anymore.” When you discard a Class card, you become classless until you play another Class card.\n",
      "You may not belong to more than one class at once unless you play the Super Munchkin card.\n",
      "Race: Characters may be Humans, Elves, Dwarves, or Halflings. If you have no Race card in front of you, you are human.\n",
      "Humans have no special abilities. The rules for Classes, above, also apply to Races.\n",
      "You may not belong to more than one race at once unless you play the Half-Breed card.\n",
      "\n",
      "SUPER MUNCHKIN AND HALF-BREED\n",
      "These cards may be played whenever it is legal to play a Class or Race, as long as you have an appropriate card (Class for Super Munchkin, Race for Half-Breed) to attach it to. You cannot have more than one of the same Class or Race card in play at once.\n",
      "If you play Super Munchkin with one Class, you get all the advantages of being that Class (the ability to equip Class-only Items, monsters with penalties against that Class suffer those penalties) and none of the disadvantages (you can equip Items forbidden to that Class, and monsters do not get bonuses because of your Class). If the Class has an ability that has a cost, however, you must still pay it - you aren't that Super! If you play Super Munchkin while you have two Classes, you have all the normal advantages and disadvantages of both Classes. (All of the above is also true for Half-Breed, just for Races.)\n",
      "\n",
      "TREASURES\n",
      "Treasure cards include permanent and “one-shot” cards. Any Treasure card may be played to the table as soon as you get it, or at any time on your own turn except during combat (unless the rules below or the card itself says otherwise).\n",
      "\n",
      "ITEMS\n",
      "Most Treasures are Items. Items have a Gold Piece value. “No Value” is equivalent to zero Gold Pieces, and a “No Value” card is considered an Item.\n",
      "All Items you have in play are considered “carried.” Items that are actually giving you a bonus are “equipped.” You should indicate Items that are not equipped by turning the cards sideways. You may not alter the status of your Items during a combat or while running away.\n",
      "Anyone can carry any Item (except for extra Big items; see below), but you may equip only one Headgear, one suit of Armor, one pair of Footgear, and two “I Hand” Items (or one “2 Hands” Item) . . . unless you have a card that lets you ignore these limits, such as Hireling or Cheat!, or unless one of the cards says otherwise. If you are carrying two Headgear cards, for instance, you can equip only one of them at a time.\n",
      "Likewise, some Items have restrictions: for instance, the Mace of Sharpness can only be wielded by a Cleric. Its bonus only counts for someone who is, at the moment, a Cleric.\n",
      "You cannot discard Item cards “just because.” You may sell Items for a level, trade Items with other players, or give an Item to another player who wants it (see below). You may discard Items to power certain Class and Race abilities. And a Curse or a monster's Bad Stuff (see p. 5) may force you to get rid of something!\n",
      "Big Items: You may carry any number of Small items, but only one Big one. (Any item not marked Big is considered Small.) You may not discard one Big item to play another; you must sell the first Item, trade it, lose it to a Curse or Bad Stuff, or discard it to power a Class or Race ability.\n",
      "lf something lets you have more than one Big item (for instance, the Dwarf race) and you lose that ability, you must either correct the problem immediately or get rid of all but one Big item. If it's your turn and you're not in combat, you can sell the excess Big items (as long as you have at least Level Counters: It’s Not Cheating, It’s Using the Rules!\n",
      "If you have an iOS or Android device, you'll like our Level Counter app. Just search for “Munchkin level counter” or click the link at levelcounter.sjgames.com. Even better, it gives you personal in- game advantages to make your friends jealous . . . which is what being a munchkin is all about!\n",
      "1,000 Gold Pieces of Items to sell). Otherwise, you must give them to the lowest-Level player(s) who can carry them! If any Big items are still left over, discard them. Trading: You may trade Items (but no other cards) with other players. You may only trade Items from the table - not from your hand. You may trade at any time except when you or your trading partner are in combat — in fact, the best time to trade is when it’s not your turn, Any Ttem you receive in a trade must remain in play. You may also give Items away without a trade, to bribe other players - “Tl give you my Flaming Armor if you won't help Bob fight that dragon!” You may show your hand to others. Like we could stop you. Selling Items for Levels: At any point during your turn except during combat or Running Away, you may discard Items worth a total of at least 1,000 Gold Pieces and immediately go up one level. (“No Value” cards are the same as zero Gold Pieces.) If you discard (for instance) 1,100 Gold Pieces worth, you don't get change. But if you can manage 2,000 worth, you can go up two levels at once, and so on. You may sell Items from your hand as well as those you are carrying. You may not sell Items to go to Level 10.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"ONE-SHOT” TREASURES\n",
      "A Treasure card that says “Usable once only” is often called a “one-shot” Treasure. Most of these are used during combat to strengthen the munchkins or the monsters, and may be played from your hand or from the table. Some have other effects, however, so read the card carefully! Discard these cards as soon as the combat is over or their effect is resolved.\n",
      "One-shot Items with a Gold Piece value may be sold for levels, just like other Items.\n",
      "\n",
      "OTHER TREASURES\n",
      "Other Treasure cards (like Go Up a Level cards) are not Items. Most of these cards say when they can be played, and whether they stay in play or are discarded. A couple of specific examples: Go Upa Level cards may be played on yourself or any other player at any time, even during combat. Discard them once they are played. Exception: You cannot play a Go Up a Level card to give a player the winning level!\n",
      "Hireling may be played at any time, on any turn. You cannot give a Hireling an Item to carry while you are in combat, however.\n",

      "COMBAT\n",
      "To fight a monster, compare its combat strength to yours. Combat strength is the total of Level plus all modifiers - positive or negative - given by Items and other cards. If the monster's combat strength is equal to yours, or greater, you lose the combat and must Run Away (see p. 5). If your combat strength totals more than the monster's — note that monsters win ties! — you kill it and goupa level (two levels for some big monsters). You'll also get the number of Treasures shown on its card.\n",
      "Sometimes a card will let you get rid of the monster without killing it. This is still “winning,” but you don't get a level. Unless the ability says otherwise, you don’t get the Treasures, either. If the last monster is removed from a combat, it ends instantly.\n",
      "Some monster cards have special powers that affect combat — a bonus against a Race or Class, for instance. Be sure to check these!\n",
      "You and the other players may play one-shot Treasures or use Class or Race abilities to help or harm you in your combat. Some Door cards may also be played into a combat, such as monster enhancers (see below).\n",
      "If you kill a monster (or monsters!), discard the monster(s) and any other cards played, and claim your rewards. But note: someone may play a hostile card on you, or use a special power, just as you think you have won. When you kill a monster, you must wait a reasonable time, defined as about 2.6 seconds, for anyone else to speak up. After that, you have really killed the monster, and you really get the level(s) and Treasures, though they can still whine and argue.\n",

      "All enhancers on a single monster add together. If there are multiple monsters in a combat, the person who plays each enhancer must choose which monster it applies to.\n",

      "Some cards (such as Wandering Monster) allow your rivals to send other monsters to join the fight. You must defeat their combined combat strengths. Any special abilities, such as forcing you to fight with your Level only, apply to the entire fight. If you have the right cards, you can eliminate one monster from the combat and fight the other(s) normally, but you cannot choose to fight one and Run Away from the other(s). If you eliminate one monster, but then run from the other(s), you don’t get any levels or Treasure!\n",

Only one player can help you, adding their combat strength to yours. Anyone can play cards to affect your combat, however!\n",
      "You'll probably have to bribe someone to help. You may offer your helper any Item(s) you are currently carrying, or any number of the Treasure cards the monster has. If you offer part of the monster's Treasure, you must agree whether they pick first, or you pick first, or whatever. You may also offer to play any cards from your hand that you legally could, such as Go Up a Level cards, on your helper.\n",
      "The special abilities or vulnerabilities of the monster also apply to your helper, and vice versa. For instance, if a Warrior helps you, you will win if your combined total ties that of the monster, and your helper can Berserk and discard cards to add their his combat strength (but only once per combat, not once per monster). If you are facing the Wannabe Vampire and a Cleric helps you, they can chase it away automatically. But if you are facing the Drooling Slime and an Elf helps you, the monster's combat strength is increased by 4 (unless you, too, are an Elf and the monster's combat strength has already been increased).\n",
      "If someone successfully helps you kill the monster, discard it, draw Treasures (see Rewards, below), and follow any special instructions on the monster card. You level up for each slain monster. Your helper does not go up any levels . . . unless the helper is an Elf, in which case they gain one level for each monster slain. You draw the Treasure cards, even if it was your helper’s special ability that defeated the monster, and distribute them according to the agreement you reached.\n",
      "A few cards or abilities allow you to compel another player to help you in combat. These abilities do not work if you are fighting for the win - and if you force someone to help and then the fight becomes one for the win, your helper gets to back out without penalty. However, if you voluntarily help someone, you don't get to back out just because they're about to win the game — so pay attention!\n",

      "Interfering With Combat\n",
      "You can interfere with others’ combats in several ways, including: Use a one-shot card. You could help another player by using a one-shot to strengthen their side. Of course, you can “accidentally” strengthen the monster with it, instead. . .\n",
      "Play a monster enhancer. These cards (usually) make a monster stronger .. . and give it more Treasure. You can play these either during your own combats or during someone else's combat.\n",

Draw that many Treasures, modified by any monster enhancers played on it. Draw face-down if you killed the monster alone. Draw face-up, so the whole party can see what you got, if someone helped you, even if they aren't taking any Treasures. (Sucker.)\n",
      "If you defeat a monster by nonlethal means, you do not get a level and you may or may not get the Treasure, depending on the method.\n",

      "Aric: Curses!\n",
      "Suzan: Want some help? (Suzan is playing a Level 2 Elf with the Boots of Butt-Kicking, so her combat strength is 4. Combined with Aric’s 12, they would have 16, enough to defeat the Net Troll’s 15.)\n",

      "If you fail to Run Away from a monster, it does Bad Stuff to you, as described on its card. This may vary from losing an Item, to losing one or more levels, to Death (see below).\n",
      "If you are fleeing from multiple monsters, you roll separately to escape each one, in any order you choose, and suffer Bad Stuff from each one that catches you as soon as it catches you.\n",
      "If two players are cooperating and still can’t defeat the monster(s), they must both Run Away. They roll separately for each monster, in whatever order they like. (If they can't decide, roll the die; the high roller decides who Runs Away first.) The monster(s) CAN catch them both.\n",

If you have an Item carried bya Hireling or attached to a Cheat! card, separate those cards.

If acquired some other way, such as by Looting The Room, Curse cards go into your hand and may be played on any player at any time. Reducing someone's abilities just as they think they have killed a monster is a lot of fun.\n",

Keep these cards until you get rid of the Curse or the penalty takes effect. (Curse cards you keep as a reminder may not be discarded to power Class or Race abilities. Nice try!)
