If you land on \\\"Go\\\" after drawing the card, you do not collect $200.\\n\\nResponse 1: No, you cannot collect $200 if you draw the \\\"Go to Jail\\\" card.\\n\\nResponse 2: When you go to jail, you do not pass \\\"Go\\\", so yo do not collect $200.\\n\\nResponse 3: No, you cannot collect $200.\\n\\nResponse 4: No, because you do not pass \\\"Go\\\". On your next turn, you can pay $50 to get out of jail if you roll doubles.\\n\\nResponse 5: No, you cannot collect $200, you can use a \\\"Get out of Jail Free\\\" card or pay $50 to get out of jail on your next turn.\\n\\nResponse 6: If you pass \\\"Go\\\" you may collect $200.

The rule states that you can carry any number of Small items and only one Big item.\\n> Response 2: No, you cannot carry multiple Big items as long as only one is equipped. The rules state that you can equip only one Headgear, one suit of Armor, one pair of Footgear, and two \\\"I Hand\\\" Items (or one \\\"2 Hands\\\" Item) unless you have a card that allows you to ignore these limits, such as Hireling or Cheat!, or unless one of the cards says otherwise.\\n> Response 3: No, you cannot carry multiple big items so long as only one is equipped.
