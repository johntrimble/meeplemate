    "To fight a monster, compare its combat strength to yours. Combat strength is the total of Level plus all modifiers - positive or negative - given by Items and other cards. If the monster's combat strength is equal to yours, or greater, you lose the combat and must Run Away (see p. 5). If your combat strength totals more than the monster's — note that monsters win ties! — you kill it and goupa level (two levels for some big monsters). You'll also get the number of Treasures shown on its card.\n",
    "Sometimes a card will let you get rid of the monster without killing it. This is still “winning,” but you don't get a level. Unless the ability says otherwise, you don’t get the Treasures, either. If the last monster is removed from a combat, it ends instantly.\n",

    "If you kill a monster (or monsters!), discard the monster(s) and any other cards played, and claim your rewards. But note: someone may play a hostile card on you, or use a special power, just as you think you have won. When you kill a monster, you must wait a reasonable time, defined as about 2.6 seconds, for anyone else to speak up.
