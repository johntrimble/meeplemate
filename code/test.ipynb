Most of these are used during combat to strengthen the munchkins or the monsters, and may be played from your hand or from the table. Some have other effects, however, so read the card carefully! Discard these cards as soon as the combat is over or their effect is resolved.\n",

      "query: Can I use a card to compel another player to help me in combat if winning that combat would give me the winning level?\n",
      "answer: The rules of Munchkin specify that certain abilities can be used to compel another player to help you in combat. If winning the combat would result in you gaining the winning level, your helper cannot back out. If you are unable to win a combat on your own, you may ask another player to help you. The player will add their combat strength to yours, and the abilities and vulnerabilities of the monster also apply to your helper, and vice versa. If someone successfully helps you kill the monster, you discard it, draw treasure cards, and follow any special instructions on the monster card. You gain experience points for each slain monster, and your helper does not. The rules in the rulebook take precedence over any card effects, and disputes should be settled by loud arguments, with the owner of the game having the last word.\n",

      "query: Can I play a Curse while in combat?\n",
      "answer: The passage describes the rules and effects of Curse cards in the game \"The Adventure Game.\" If a player draws a Curse card during the Kick Open The Door phase, it applies to the person who drew it. If acquired some other way, such as by Looting The Room, Curse cards go into the player's hand and may be played on any player at any time. Curse cards can have a variety of effects, such as reducing someone's abilities, cursing an Item, or causing a player to lose Treasure. If a Curse applies to multiple Items, the player who draws the Curse gets to choose which Item is affected by the Curse. If a Curse cannot affect an Item, it will not have any effect on that Item. It's important to read the effects of each Curse carefully before playing it, as some Curses have alternate effects that may be useful in certain situations. If a Curse that applies to an Item you don't have, you don't need to worry about it. The Curse will simply be discarded and won't have any effect on you. Sometimes using a Curse or Monster card on yourself can be beneficial, especially if it will help you gain an advantage or protect yourself from an incoming threat. Similarly, helping another player in a way that costs them Treasure can also be useful, especially if you are working together as a team.\n",

When the rules or cards refer to your Level, capitalized, they mean this number. You gain a level when you kill a monster, or when a card says that you do. You can also sell Items to buy levels (see Items). You lose a level when a card says you do. Your Level can never go below 1. However, your combat strength can be negative, if you get hit by a Curse or suffer some other kind of penalty.\\nClass: Characters may be Warriors, Wizards, Thieves, or Clerics. If you have no Class card in front of you, you have no class. Yeah, I know, we did that one already.\\nEach Class has special abilities, shown on the cards. You gain the abilities of a Class the moment you play its card in front of you, and lose them as soon as you discard that card. Some Class abilities are powered by discards. You may discard any card, in play or in your hand, to power a special ability.\\nSee the Class cards for when abilities can be used. Note that a Thief cannot steal while he or the target is fighting - and as soon as a monster is revealed, the fight is on!\\nYou can discard a Class card at any time, even in combat: “I don't wanna be a wizard anymore.” When you discard a Class card, you become classless until you play another Class card.\\nYou may not belong to more than one class at once unless you play the Super Munchkin card.\",\n",

An Elf normally has a bonus to Run Away, but he has a penalty if he is riding the Turtle Steed! If your Steed gives you a penalty to Run Away, you may discard the Steed before you roll to flee. You don’t suffer the penalty, but the card goes to the discard pile.\\n\\nTreating Steeds as Monsters\\nA player who draws a face-up Steed may choose to treat it as a monster instead. In that case, its Level is equal to twice the combat bonus at the top of the card, and defeating it is good for one Treasure and one level. Monster Enhancers may be played on Steeds being fought as monsters, and have their normal effects. The Bad Stuff for any Steed attacked as a monster is “Lose a level.”\\n---\\n\"\n",

For instance, you might describe your character as a “Level 8 Elf Wizard with Boots of Butt-Kicking, a Staff of Napalm, and the Kneepads of Allure.” Level: This is a measure of how generally buff and studly you are. When the rules or cards refer to your Level, capitalized, they mean this number. You gain a level when you kill a monster, or when a card says that you do. You can also sell Items to buy levels (see Items). You lose a level when a card says you do. Your Level can never go below 1. However, your combat strength can be negative, if you get hit by a Curse or suffer some other kind of penalty.\\nClass: Characters may be Warriors, Wizards, Thieves, or Clerics. If you have no Class card in front of you, you have no class. Yeah, I know, we did that one already.\\nEach Class has special abilities, shown on the cards. You gain the abilities of a Class the moment you play its card in front of you, and lose them as soon as you discard that card. Some Class abilities are powered by discards. You may discard any card, in play or in your hand, to power a special ability.\\nSee the Class cards for when abilities can be used. Note that a Thief cannot steal while he or the target is fighting - and as soon as a monster is revealed, the fight is on!\\nYou can discard a Class card at any time, even in combat: “I don't wanna be a wizard anymore.” When you discard a Class card, you become classless until you play another Class card.\\nYou may not belong to more than one class at once unless you play the Super Munchkin card.\\n---\\n\\n\\n---\\nNAME: munchkin_rules/munchkin_rules-1.pdf\\nPAGE: 4\\nPASSAGE:\\nInterfering With Combat\\nYou can interfere with others’ combats in several ways, including: Use a one-shot card.

They don’t help you, but they can’t be taken away except by cards that specifically affect “your hand.” At the end of your turn, you may have no more than five cards in your hand (see Charity, p- 2).\\nCards in play may not be returned to your hand - they must be discarded or traded if you want to get rid of them.\\n---\\n\\n\\n---\\nNAME: munchkin_rules/munchkin_rules-1.pdf\\nPAGE: 3\\nPASSAGE:\\n\\\"ONE-SHOT” TREASURES\\nA Treasure card that says “Usable once only” is often called a “one-shot” Treasure. Most of these are used during combat to strengthen the munchkins or the monsters, and may be played from your hand or from the table. Some have other effects, however, so read the card carefully! Discard these cards as soon as the combat is over or their effect is resolved.\\nOne-shot Items with a Gold Piece value may be sold for levels, just like other Items.\\n\\nOTHER TREASURES\\nOther Treasure cards (like Go Up a Level cards) are not Items. Most of these cards say when they can be played, and whether they stay in play or are discarded. A couple of specific examples: Go Upa Level cards may be played on yourself or any other player at any time, even during combat. Discard them once they are played. Exception: You cannot play a Go Up a Level card to give a player the winning level!\\nHireling may be played at any time, on any turn. You cannot give a Hireling an Item to carry while you are in combat, however.\\n---\\n\\n\\n---\\nNAME: munchkin_rules/munchkin_rules-1.pdf\\nPAGE: 2\\nPASSAGE:\\nCHARACTER STATS\\nEach character is basically a collection of weapons, armor, and magic items, with three stats: Level, Race, and Class. For instance, you might describe your character as a “Level 8 Elf Wizard with Boots of Butt-Kicking, a Staff of Napalm, and the Kneepads of Allure.” Level: This is a measure of how generally buff and studly you are. When the rules or cards refer to your Level, capitalized, they mean this number. You gain a level when you kill a monster, or when a card says that you do. You can also sell Items to buy levels (see Items). You lose a level when a card says you do. Your Level can never go below 1. However, your combat strength can be negative, if you get hit by a Curse or suffer some other kind of penalty.\\nClass: Characters may be Warriors, Wizards, Thieves, or Clerics. If you have no Class card in front of you, you have no class. Yeah, I know, we did that one already.\\nEach Class has special abilities, shown on the cards. You gain the abilities of a Class the moment you play its card in front of you, and lose them as soon as you discard that card. Some Class abilities are powered by discards. You may discard any card, in play or in your hand, to power a special ability.\\nSee the Class cards for when abilities can be used. Note that a Thief cannot steal while he or the target is fighting - and as soon as a monster is revealed, the fight is on!\\nYou can discard a Class card at any time, even in combat: “I don't wanna be a wizard anymore.” When you discard a Class card, you become classless until you play another Class card.\\nYou may not belong to more than one class at once unless you play the Super Munchkin card.\\n---\\n\\n\\n---\\nNAME: munchkin_rules/munchkin_rules-1.pdf\\nPAGE: 4\\nPASSAGE:\\nInterfering With Combat\\nYou can interfere with others’ combats in several ways, including: Use a one-shot card. You could help another player by using a one-shot to strengthen their side. Of course, you can “accidentally” strengthen the monster with it, instead. . .\\nPlay a monster enhancer. These cards (usually) make a monster stronger .. . and give it more Treasure. You can play these either during your own combats or during someone else's combat.\\nAdd a monster from your hand to join the combat, either with a Wandering Monster card or by using the special Undead rule.\\nBackstab a player in combat, if you're a Thief.\\nCurse them, if you have a Curse card.\\n\\nREWARDS\\nWhen you kill a monster, you get one level per monster, unless the monster card says something else, and you get all its Treasure! Each monster has a Treasure number on the bottom of its card. Draw that many Treasures, modified by any monster enhancers played on it. Draw face-down if you killed the monster alone. Draw face-up, so the whole party can see what you got, if someone helped you, even if they aren't taking any Treasures. (Sucker.)\\nIf you defeat a monster by nonlethal means, you do not get a level and you may or may not get the Treasure, depending on the method.\\nTreasure cards can be played as soon as you get them, even if you are the helper.\\n---\\n\\n\\n---\\nNAME: munchkin_rules/munch_4_rules_20thp.pdf\\nPAGE: 2\\nPASSAGE:\\nSTEEDS\\nDear to a munchkin’s heart (as of now) is his mighty Steed. Because, of course, it gives bonuses. Steeds are found in the Door deck.\\nNo player can have more than one Steed except by using a Cheat! card.\\nSteeds are Items, and follow normal Item rules. Anything that affects an Item can affect a Steed.\\nSteeds carry themselves. A Steed is “Big,” but it does not count against the number of Big items you can carry (in fact, some let you carry more Big things). The “Big” designation on Steeds is to control what Traps and Curses affect them, and to keep Thieves from pocketing them and walking off.\\nThere are a few Items that specifically enhance Steeds. Steeds cannot use Items unless the Item card specifically says so, and Item Enhancers don’t affect Steed-enhancing Items.\\nIf a Steed has a bonus or penalty to Run Away, that replaces the bonus of the rider. An Elf normally has a bonus to Run Away, but he has a penalty if he is riding the Turtle Steed! If your Steed gives you a penalty to Run Away, you may discard the Steed before you roll to flee. You don’t suffer the penalty, but the card goes to the discard pile.\\n\\nTreating Steeds as Monsters\\nA player who draws a face-up Steed may choose to treat it as a monster instead. In that case, its Level is equal to twice the combat bonus at the top of the card, and defeating it is good for one Treasure and one level. Monster Enhancers may be played on Steeds being fought as monsters, and have their normal effects. The Bad Stuff for any Steed attacked as a monster is “Lose a level.”\\n---\\n\"\n",

The player is asking for guidance on how to walk through the context of the question in a manageable way.\\n3. The player is asking for information on how to summarize and analyze the context as they go.\\n\\nTo answer the question, we need to consider the rules of the game and the specific card in question.\\n\\nAccording to the rules of the game, a player can perform certain actions on their turn, including playing a card that they have just received. The \\\"Go Up a Level\\\" card is one type of card that can be played during a player's turn.\\n\\nHowever, it is not clear from the question whether the player is asking if they can play the \\\"Go Up a Level\\\" card during combat specifically, or if they can play any card during combat.\\n\\nIf the player is asking if they can play the \\\"Go Up a Level\\\" card during combat specifically, then the answer is no. According to the rules of the game, a player can go up a level after combat only if they have killed a monster. Therefore, during combat, a player cannot play a \\\"Go Up a Level\\\" card.\\n\\nIf the player is asking if they can play any card during combat, then the answer is yes. The rules of the game allow a player to play cards during their turn, and during combat, a player can choose to play a card if they wish.\\n\\nIn summary, the player can play the \\\"Go Up a Level\\\" card during their turn, but not during combat. If the player is asking about other cards that can be played during combat, the answer is yes.\\n\\nTherefore, the answer is\"\n",

In that case, its Level is equal to twice the combat bonus at the top of the card, and defeating it is good for one Treasure and one level. Monster Enhancers may be played on Steeds being fought as monsters, and have their normal effects. The Bad Stuff for any Steed attacked as a monster is “Lose a level.”\\n---\\n\",\n",

For instance, you might describe your character as a “Level 8 Elf Wizard with Boots of Butt-Kicking, a Staff of Napalm, and the Kneepads of Allure.” Level: This is a measure of how generally buff and studly you are. When the rules or cards refer to your Level, capitalized, they mean this number. You gain a level when you kill a monster, or when a card says that you do.

Many cards add special rules, so in most cases when the rulesheet disagrees with a card, follow the card. However, ignore any card effect that might seem to contradict one of the rules listed below unless the card explicitly says it supersedes that rule!\\niL Nothing can reduce a player below Level 1, although card effects might reduce a player's or a monster's combat strength (p. 3) below I.\\n2. You go up a level after combat only if you Ail a monster.\\n3. You cannot collect rewards for defeating a monster (eg., Treasure, levels) in the middle of a combat. You must finish the fight before gaining any rewards.\\n4. You must killa monster to reach Level 10, and you cannot force another player to help you do it.\\nAny other disputes should be settled by loud arguments, with the owner of the game having the last word. You could also read the Munchkin FAQ and errata pages at munchkin.game, or start a discussion at forums.sjgames.com/, munchkin . . . unless it’s more fun to argue.\\n\\nSTEVE JACKSON GAMES\\nYour Hand: Cards in your hand are not in play. They don’t help you, but they can’t be taken away except by cards that specifically affect “your hand.” At the end of your turn, you may have no more than five cards in your hand (see Charity, p- 2).\\nCards in play may not be returned to your hand - they must be discarded or traded if you want to get rid of them.\\n---\\n\\n\\n---\\nNAME: munchkin_rules/munchkin_rules-1.pdf\\nPAGE: 3\\nPASSAGE:\\n\\\"ONE-SHOT” TREASURES\\nA Treasure card that says “Usable once only” is often called a “one-shot” Treasure. Most of these are used during combat to strengthen the munchkins or the monsters, and may be played from your hand or from the table. Some have other effects, however, so read the card carefully! Discard these cards as soon as the combat is over or their effect is resolved.\\nOne-shot Items with a Gold Piece value may be sold for levels, just like other Items.\\n\\nOTHER TREASURES\\nOther Treasure cards (like Go Up a Level cards) are not Items. Most of these cards say when they can be played, and whether they stay in play or are discarded. A couple of specific examples: Go Upa Level cards may be played on yourself or any other player at any time, even during combat. Discard them once they are played. Exception: You cannot play a Go Up a Level card to give a player the winning level!\\nHireling may be played at any time, on any turn.

For instance, you might describe your character as a “Level 8 Elf Wizard with Boots of Butt-Kicking, a Staff of Napalm, and the Kneepads of Allure.” Level: This is a measure of how generally buff and studly you are. When the rules or cards refer to your Level, capitalized, they mean this number. You gain a level when you kill a monster, or when a card says that you do. You can also sell Items to buy levels (see Items). You lose a level when a card says you do. Your Level can never go below 1. However, your combat strength can be negative, if you get hit by a Curse or suffer some other kind of penalty.\\nClass: Characters may be Warriors, Wizards, Thieves, or Clerics.
