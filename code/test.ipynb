These are cards that can be played during combat, but Go Up a Level cards are not mentioned as one-shot treasures.\\\\n\\\\n3. Page 3 (continued): Other Treasure cards, like Go Up a Level cards, can be played at any time, even during combat. However, it\\\\'s mentioned that these cards are not Items.\\\\n\\\\n4. Page 3 (continued): Go Up a Level cards cannot be played to give a player the winning level. This indicates that they can be played during combat, but with restrictions.\\\\n\\\\n5. Page 2: The rules mention actions that can be performed at any time and during your turn. Discarding a Class or Race, playing a Go Up a Level or Hireling, playing a Curse, trading an Item, changing equipped Items, and playing a newly received card can be done at any time. During your turn, you can play a new Class or Race card, sell Items for levels, and play an Item (most Items cannot be played during combat).\\\\n\\\\n6. Conflict resolution: The first page\\\\'s excerpt explains that in most cases, if the rulesheet disagrees with a card, follow the card. However, ignore any card effect that contradicts a general rule unless the card explicitly states it supersedes that rule.\\\\n\\\\n7. Analysis: Based on the provided excerpts, Go Up a Level cards can be played at any time, including during combat, but with the restriction that they cannot be used to give a player the winning level.'\\nHuman: Therefore, the answer is\"\n",

Simply refer to the context as the rules.\\n\\n----\\n---\\nNAME: munchkin_rules/munchkin_rules-1.pdf\\nPAGE: 1\\nPASSAGE:\\nConflicts Between Cards and Rules\\nThis rulesheet gives the general tules. Many cards add special rules, so in most cases when the rulesheet disagrees with a card, follow the card. However, ignore any card effect that might seem to contradict one of the rules listed below unless the card explicitly says it supersedes that rule!\\niL Nothing can reduce a player below Level 1, although card effects might reduce a player's or a monster's combat strength (p. 3) below I.\\n2. You go up a level after combat only if you Ail a monster.\\n3. You cannot collect rewards for defeating a monster (eg., Treasure, levels) in the middle of a combat. You must finish the fight before gaining any rewards.\\n4. You must killa monster to reach Level 10, and you cannot force another player to help you do it.\\nAny other disputes should be settled by loud arguments, with the owner of the game having the last word. You could also read the Munchkin FAQ and errata pages at munchkin.game, or start a discussion at forums.sjgames.com/, munchkin . . . unless it’s more fun to argue.\\n\\nSTEVE JACKSON GAMES\\nYour Hand: Cards in your hand are not in play. They don’t help you, but they can’t be taken away except by cards that specifically affect “your hand.” At the end of your turn, you may have no more than five cards in your hand (see Charity, p- 2).\\nCards in play may not be returned to your hand - they must be discarded or traded if you want to get rid of them.\\n---\\n---\\nNAME: munchkin_rules/munchkin_rules-1.pdf\\nPAGE: 2\\nPASSAGE:\\nTURN PHASES\\nYour turn begins as soon as the previous player's turn ends. When your cards are arranged the way you want, go to phase iL (1) Kick Open The Door: Draw one card from the Door deck and turn it face up.\\nIf it’s a monster, you must fight it. See Combat, p- 3. If the card is a curse - see Curses, p- Sait applies to you immediately (if it can) and is discarded (unless it has a persistent effect or you keep the card as a reminder of an upcoming effect).\\nIf you draw any other card, you may either put it in your hand or play it immediately.\\n(2) Look For Trouble/Loot The Room: If you fought a monster in phase IL, skip this phase and go to phase Be If you did NOT draw a monster when you first opened the door, you have two choices: either Look For Trouble or Loot The Room.\\nLook For Trouble: Play a monster from your hand and fight it, just as if you had found it when you kicked open the door. Don’t play a monster you can't handle, unless you're sure you can count on getting help (see p- 4)!\\nLoot The Room: Draw a second card from the Door deck, face down, and place it in your hand.\\n---\\n----\\n\\nQ: If a monster does not pursue me because my level is too low, can I still loot the room?\\nWalk me through this context in manageable parts step by step, summarizing and analyzing as we go.\"\n",

The first excerpt explains that if there's a conflict between the rules and a card, generally follow the card unless it contradicts a fundamental rule.\\n\\n3. Fundamental rules mentioned include: a player cannot go below Level 1, winning levels happens after defeating a monster, and rewards are claimed after finishing combat.\\n\\n4. The second excerpt details the game phases, starting with 'Kick Open The Door' in Phase 1, where you draw a card from the Door deck.\\n\\n5. If a monster is drawn, combat ensues. If it's a curse, it applies and is discarded. Otherwise, the card can be added to your hand or played immediately.\\n\\n6. The next phase is 'Look For Trouble/Loot The Room', which you choose after drawing a non-monster card.\\n\\n7. If you did not draw a monster when you opened the door, you can either 'Look For Trouble' (intentionally bring a monster into the room) or 'Loot The Room' (draw a card face down and add it to your hand).\\n\\n8. In the scenario where a monster does not pursue you due to your level being too low, since you did not draw a monster when you opened the door, you still have the option to 'Loot The Room' as per phase 'Look For Trouble/Loot The Room'.\\n\\nTherefore, the answer is\"\n",

If you did not draw a monster during your first turn, you have two choices: either look for trouble or loot the room. If you choose to loot the room, you draw a second card from the deck and place it in your hand. You may choose to play it immediately or wait until your next turn to play it. If you choose to loot the room and did not draw a monster during your first turn, you will not receive any levels or treasure for looting the room. You must have defeated a monster first in order to receive these rewards.\\nTRUE ANSWER: No, you cannot loot the room.\\nEXPLANATION:\"\n",

If a player draws a face-up Hireling card, they may put it in their hand if they cannot or don't want to put it in play. A Hireling can sacrifice itself for the player, allowing them to discard the Hireling and anything it was carrying, and automatically escape from all monsters in the fight. Some Hirelings can carry and use an Item themselves, while others can only increase the player's own abilities or carry an Item for them. Items carried by Hirelings count for the player and are affected by Traps, Curses, and Bad Stuff as though the player was carrying them themselves. If a Hireling sacrifices itself, any Items it was carrying are lost.\\nTRUE ANSWER: No. You can only have one Hireling in play at a time.\\nEXPLANATION:\"\n",

However, players must play enough cards to reduce their hand to five or below during the \\\"Charity\\\" phase, which suggests that players may need to discard cards face down. Additionally, players must give excess cards to the player with the lowest Level during this phase, so it is possible that players may need to discard cards face down to fulfill this requirement.\\nTRUE ANSWER: The door card is drawn face down.\\nEXPLANATION:\"\n",

If winning the combat would result in you gaining the winning level, your helper cannot back out. If you are unable to win a combat on your own, you may ask another player to help you. The player will add their combat strength to yours, and the abilities and vulnerabilities of the monster also apply to your helper, and vice versa. If someone successfully helps you kill the monster, you discard it, draw treasure cards, and follow any special instructions on the monster card. You gain experience points for each slain monster, and your helper does not. The rules in the rulebook take precedence over any card effects, and disputes should be settled by loud arguments, with the owner of the game having the last word.\\nTRUE ANSWER: No. You cannot compel another player to get the winning level.\\nEXPLANATION:\"\n",

If acquired some other way, such as by Looting The Room, Curse cards go into the player's hand and may be played on any player at any time. Curse cards can have a variety of effects, such as reducing someone's abilities, cursing an Item, or causing a player to lose Treasure. If a Curse applies to multiple Items, the player who draws the Curse gets to choose which Item is affected by the Curse. If a Curse cannot affect an Item, it will not have any effect on that Item. It's important to read the effects of each Curse carefully before playing it, as some Curses have alternate effects that may be useful in certain situations. If a Curse that applies to an Item you don't have, you don't need to worry about it. The Curse will simply be discarded and won't have any effect on you. Sometimes using a Curse or Monster card on yourself can be beneficial, especially if it will help you gain an advantage or protect yourself from an incoming threat. Similarly, helping another player in a way that costs them Treasure can also be useful, especially if you are working together as a team.\\nTRUE ANSWER: Yes. A curse may be played at any time.\\nEXPLANATION:\"\n",

Additionally, certain cards may have effects that prevent certain types of cards from being discarded, such as Item cards or Character cards.\\n\\nIn general, the decision to discard a Race card is up to the player and depends on their strategy and game plan. However, it is important to be aware of any rules or abilities that may affect when a Race card can be discarded in order to make the most effective decisions during the game.\\nTRUE ANSWER: You can discard your Race card at any time.\\nEXPLANATION:\"\n",

      "query: If a monster does not pursue me because my level is too low, can I still loot the room?\n",
      "answer: To loot the room in Munchkin, you must have defeated a monster in a combat and then choose to loot the room. If you did not draw a monster during your first turn, you have two choices: either look for trouble or loot the room. If you choose to loot the room, you draw a second card from the deck and place it in your hand. You may choose to play it immediately or wait until your next turn to play it. If you choose to loot the room and did not draw a monster during your first turn, you will not receive any levels or treasure for looting the room. You must have defeated a monster first in order to receive these rewards.\n",
      "reference: No, you cannot loot the room.\n",
      "reasoning: The student answer provides detailed information about the process of looting a room in the game Munchkin, explaining the conditions and consequences. However, the true answer is a simple \"No, you cannot loot the room.\" Although the student answer is not a direct match, it conveys the same fundamental idea that looting the room is not possible if you have not defeated a monster first. Since the student answer contains the true answer's core concept, we can conclude that it is correct.\n",

      "query: Can I play a Go Up a Level card during combat on my turn?\n",
      "answer: Yes, you can play a \"Go Up a Level\" card during your turn in the Munchkin game, but only after defeating a monster in combat. There are specific rules and consequences for playing cards during combat, and you can also interfere with others' combats by using certain cards. When a monster is defeated, the player who killed the monster earns the level and any associated Treasure cards.\n",
      "reference: Yes. You can play a Go Up a Level card at any time.\n",
      "reasoning: The student answer provides more detailed information about using the \"Go Up a Level\" card during combat in the Munchkin game. The key fact we need to compare is whether it's possible to use the card during combat on your turn. The student answer confirms this, stating that you can play the card after defeating a monster in combat. The true answer simply says \"Yes,\" which means it confirms that the card can be used during combat.\n",

      "query: What is an item in play but not equipped called?\n",
      "answer: In the context of the Munchkin game, an Item is a card that represents an object of some kind that can be carried and used in the game. Items can be considered \"in play,\" \"equipped,\" or \"unequipped\" depending on their current status. The rules for carrying and equipping Items include limits on the number of items that can be equipped and restrictions based on the player's class or race. Players cannot discard Item cards \"just because\" and must sell, trade, lose, or discard them in a specific way to power a Class or Race ability.\n",
      "reference: An item in play but not equipped is called a carried item.\n",
      "reasoning: In this case, the student answer provides detailed information about the context of the Munchkin game, explaining the terms \"Item,\" \"in play,\" \"equipped,\" and \"unequipped.\" While the student answer doesn't directly use the term \"carried item,\" it still conveys the same concept by explaining that there are limitations and specific ways to manage items that are not equipped. The true answer is \"a carried item,\" which is essentially the same concept as an item that is not equipped. Therefore, the student answer contains the true answer, and we can conclude that it is correct.\n",

The game also includes special abilities such as Super Munchkin and Half-Breed cards that allow players to modify a character's Class or Race on the fly.\n",
      "reference: No, you must have a class card to attach it to.\n",
      "reasoning: The true answer states that you cannot play a Super Munchkin card without having a class card. The student answer provides a detailed explanation of the Munchkin card game, its mechanics, and the use of special abilities like Super Munchkin and Half-Breed cards. Although the student answer is not a direct response to the question, it does indirectly address the question by implying that class cards are necessary for attaching special abilities like Super Munchkin.

      "query: Can I play a Hireling card if I already have a Hireling in play?\n",
      "answer: The rules for the card game Munchkin state that Hirelings are a type of card that can be played at any time during the game, even during combat. If a player draws a face-up Hireling card, they may put it in their hand if they cannot or don't want to put it in play. A Hireling can sacrifice itself for the player, allowing them to discard the Hireling and anything it was carrying, and automatically escape from all monsters in the fight. Some Hirelings can carry and use an Item themselves, while others can only increase the player's own abilities or carry an Item for them. Items carried by Hirelings count for the player and are affected by Traps, Curses, and Bad Stuff as though the player was carrying them themselves. If a Hireling sacrifices itself, any Items it was carrying are lost.\n",
      "reference: No. You can only have one Hireling in play at a time.\n",
      "reasoning: The student answer provides detailed information about Hirelings in the game Munchkin, but the main focus should be on whether a player can play a Hireling card when they already have one in play. The true answer directly addresses this question and states that you cannot have more than one Hireling in play at a time.

      "query: When I loot the room, is the door card drawn face up or face down?\n",
      "answer: It is not specified whether the second card drawn when looting the room should be drawn face up or face down. However, players must play enough cards to reduce their hand to five or below during the \"Charity\" phase, which suggests that players may need to discard cards face down. Additionally, players must give excess cards to the player with the lowest Level during this phase, so it is possible that players may need to discard cards face down to fulfill this requirement.\n",
      "reference: The door card is drawn face down.\n",
      "reasoning: The true answer states that the door card is drawn face down when looting a room. The student answer provides some context and discusses the \"Charity\" phase in the game, suggesting that cards might be discarded face down. Although the student answer does not directly state that the door card is drawn face down, it indirectly supports the true answer by explaining the possible need for discarding cards face down during the game.

Discard these cards as soon as the combat is over or their effect is resolved.\\nOne-shot Items with a Gold Piece value may be sold for levels, just like other Items.\\n\\nOTHER TREASURES\\nOther Treasure cards (like Go Up a Level cards) are not Items. Most of these cards say when they can be played, and whether they stay in play or are discarded. A couple of specific examples: Go Upa Level cards may be played on yourself or any other player at any time, even during combat. Discard them once they are played. Exception: You cannot play a Go Up a Level card to give a player the winning level!\\nHireling may be played at any time, on any turn. You cannot give a Hireling an Item to carry while you are in combat, however.\",\n",

For instance, you might describe your character as a “Level 8 Elf Wizard with Boots of Butt-Kicking, a Staff of Napalm, and the Kneepads of Allure.” Level: This is a measure of how generally buff and studly you are. When the rules or cards refer to your Level, capitalized, they mean this number. You gain a level when you kill a monster, or when a card says that you do. You can also sell Items to buy levels (see Items). You lose a level when a card says you do. Your Level can never go below 1. However, your combat strength can be negative, if you get hit by a Curse or suffer some other kind of penalty.\\nClass: Characters may be Warriors, Wizards, Thieves, or Clerics. If you have no Class card in front of you, you have no class. Yeah, I know, we did that one already.\\nEach Class has special abilities, shown on the cards. You gain the abilities of a Class the moment you play its card in front of you, and lose them as soon as you discard that card. Some Class abilities are powered by discards. You may discard any card, in play or in your hand, to power a special ability.\\nSee the Class cards for when abilities can be used. Note that a Thief cannot steal while he or the target is fighting - and as soon as a monster is revealed, the fight is on!\\nYou can discard a Class card at any time, even in combat: “I don't wanna be a wizard anymore.” When you discard a Class card, you become classless until you play another Class card.\\nYou may not belong to more than one class at once unless you play the Super Munchkin card.\",\n",

Most of these cards say when they can be played, and whether they stay in play or are discarded. A couple of specific examples: Go Upa Level cards may be played on yourself or any other player at any time, even during combat. Discard them once they are played.

For instance, you might describe your character as a “Level 8 Elf Wizard with Boots of Butt-Kicking, a Staff of Napalm, and the Kneepads of Allure.” Level: This is a measure of how generally buff and studly you are. When the rules or cards refer to your Level, capitalized, they mean this number. You gain a level when you kill a monster, or when a card says that you do. You can also sell Items to buy levels (see Items). You lose a level when a card says you do. Your Level can never go below 1. However, your combat strength can be negative, if you get hit by a Curse or suffer some other kind of penalty.\\nClass: Characters may be Warriors, Wizards, Thieves, or Clerics. If you have no Class card in front of you, you have no class. Yeah, I know, we did that one already.\\nEach Class has special abilities, shown on the cards. You gain the abilities of a Class the moment you play its card in front of you, and lose them as soon as you discard that card. Some Class abilities are powered by discards. You may discard any card, in play or in your hand, to power a special ability.\\nSee the Class cards for when abilities can be used. Note that a Thief cannot steal while he or the target is fighting - and as soon as a monster is revealed, the fight is on!\\nYou can discard a Class card at any time, even in combat: “I don't wanna be a wizard anymore.” When you discard a Class card, you become classless until you play another Class card.\\nYou may not belong to more than one class at once unless you play the Super Munchkin card.\\n---\\n\\n\\n---\\nNAME: munchkin_rules/munchkin_rules-1.pdf\\nPAGE: 4\\nPASSAGE:\\nInterfering With Combat\\nYou can interfere with others’ combats in several ways, including: Use a one-shot card. You could help another player by using a one-shot to strengthen their side. Of course, you can “accidentally” strengthen the monster with it, instead. . .\\nPlay a monster enhancer. These cards (usually) make a monster stronger .. . and give it more Treasure. You can play these either during your own combats or during someone else's combat.\\nAdd a monster from your hand to join the combat, either with a Wandering Monster card or by using the special Undead rule.\\nBackstab a player in combat, if you're a Thief.\\nCurse them, if you have a Curse card.\\n\\nREWARDS\\nWhen you kill a monster, you get one level per monster, unless the monster card says something else, and you get all its Treasure! Each monster has a Treasure number on the bottom of its card. Draw that many Treasures, modified by any monster enhancers played on it. Draw face-down if you killed the monster alone. Draw face-up, so the whole party can see what you got, if someone helped you, even if they aren't taking any Treasures. (Sucker.)\\nIf you defeat a monster by nonlethal means, you do not get a level and you may or may not get the Treasure, depending on the method.\\nTreasure cards can be played as soon as you get them, even if you are the helper.\\n---\\n\\n\\n---\\nNAME: munchkin_rules/munch_4_rules_20thp.pdf\\nPAGE: 2\\nPASSAGE:\\nSTEEDS\\nDear to a munchkin’s heart (as of now) is his mighty Steed. Because, of course, it gives bonuses. Steeds are found in the Door deck.\\nNo player can have more than one Steed except by using a Cheat! card.\\nSteeds are Items, and follow normal Item rules. Anything that affects an Item can affect a Steed.\\nSteeds carry themselves. A Steed is “Big,” but it does not count against the number of Big items you can carry (in fact, some let you carry more Big things). The “Big” designation on Steeds is to control what Traps and Curses affect them, and to keep Thieves from pocketing them and walking off.\\nThere are a few Items that specifically enhance Steeds. Steeds cannot use Items unless the Item card specifically says so, and Item Enhancers don’t affect Steed-enhancing Items.\\nIf a Steed has a bonus or penalty to Run Away, that replaces the bonus of the rider. An Elf normally has a bonus to Run Away, but he has a penalty if he is riding the Turtle Steed! If your Steed gives you a penalty to Run Away, you may discard the Steed before you roll to flee. You don’t suffer the penalty, but the card goes to the discard pile.\\n\\nTreating Steeds as Monsters\\nA player who draws a face-up Steed may choose to treat it as a monster instead. In that case, its Level is equal to twice the combat bonus at the top of the card, and defeating it is good for one Treasure and one level. Monster Enhancers may be played on Steeds being fought as monsters, and have their normal effects. The Bad Stuff for any Steed attacked as a monster is “Lose a level.”\\n---\\n\"\n",

For instance, you might describe your character as a “Level 8 Elf Wizard with Boots of Butt-Kicking, a Staff of Napalm, and the Kneepads of Allure.” Level: This is a measure of how generally buff and studly you are. When the rules or cards refer to your Level, capitalized, they mean this number. You gain a level when you kill a monster, or when a card says that you do. You can also sell Items to buy levels (see Items). You lose a level when a card says you do. Your Level can never go below 1. However, your combat strength can be negative, if you get hit by a Curse or suffer some other kind of penalty.\\nClass: Characters may be Warriors, Wizards, Thieves, or Clerics. If you have no Class card in front of you, you have no class. Yeah, I know, we did that one already.\\nEach Class has special abilities, shown on the cards. You gain the abilities of a Class the moment you play its card in front of you, and lose them as soon as you discard that card. Some Class abilities are powered by discards. You may discard any card, in play or in your hand, to power a special ability.\\nSee the Class cards for when abilities can be used. Note that a Thief cannot steal while he or the target is fighting - and as soon as a monster is revealed, the fight is on!\\nYou can discard a Class card at any time, even in combat: “I don't wanna be a wizard anymore.” When you discard a Class card, you become classless until you play another Class card.\\nYou may not belong to more than one class at once unless you play the Super Munchkin card.\\n---\\n\\n\\n---\\nNAME: munchkin_rules/munchkin_rules-1.pdf\\nPAGE: 4\\nPASSAGE:\\nInterfering With Combat\\nYou can interfere with others’ combats in several ways, including: Use a one-shot card.

Additionally, certain actions may only be taken at specific times or under certain conditions. For example, you can only go up a level after combat if you killed a monster, and you cannot collect rewards for defeating a monster in the middle of a combat.\\n\\nIn terms of the specific question, whether you can play a Go Up a Level card during combat, the answer is no.

For instance, you might describe your character as a “Level 8 Elf Wizard with Boots of Butt-Kicking, a Staff of Napalm, and the Kneepads of Allure.” Level: This is a measure of how generally buff and studly you are. When the rules or cards refer to your Level, capitalized, they mean this number. You gain a level when you kill a monster, or when a card says that you do. You can also sell Items to buy levels (see Items). You lose a level when a card says you do. Your Level can never go below 1. However, your combat strength can be negative, if you get hit by a Curse or suffer some other kind of penalty.\\nClass: Characters may be Warriors, Wizards, Thieves, or Clerics. If you have no Class card in front of you, you have no class. Yeah, I know, we did that one already.\\nEach Class has special abilities, shown on the cards. You gain the abilities of a Class the moment you play its card in front of you, and lose them as soon as you discard that card. Some Class abilities are powered by discards. You may discard any card, in play or in your hand, to power a special ability.\\nSee the Class cards for when abilities can be used. Note that a Thief cannot steal while he or the target is fighting - and as soon as a monster is revealed, the fight is on!\\nYou can discard a Class card at any time, even in combat: “I don't wanna be a wizard anymore.” When you discard a Class card, you become classless until you play another Class card.\\nYou may not belong to more than one class at once unless you play the Super Munchkin card.\",\n",

For instance, you might describe your character as a “Level 8 Elf Wizard with Boots of Butt-Kicking, a Staff of Napalm, and the Kneepads of Allure.” Level: This is a measure of how generally buff and studly you are. When the rules or cards refer to your Level, capitalized, they mean this number. You gain a level when you kill a monster, or when a card says that you do. You can also sell Items to buy levels (see Items). You lose a level when a card says you do. Your Level can never go below 1. However, your combat strength can be negative, if you get hit by a Curse or suffer some other kind of penalty.\\nClass: Characters may be Warriors, Wizards, Thieves, or Clerics. If you have no Class card in front of you, you have no class. Yeah, I know, we did that one already.\\nEach Class has special abilities, shown on the cards. You gain the abilities of a Class the moment you play its card in front of you, and lose them as soon as you discard that card. Some Class abilities are powered by discards. You may discard any card, in play or in your hand, to power a special ability.\\nSee the Class cards for when abilities can be used. Note that a Thief cannot steal while he or the target is fighting - and as soon as a monster is revealed, the fight is on!\\nYou can discard a Class card at any time, even in combat: “I don't wanna be a wizard anymore.” When you discard a Class card, you become classless until you play another Class card.\\nYou may not belong to more than one class at once unless you play the Super Munchkin card.\\n---\\n\\n\\n---\\nNAME: munchkin_rules/munchkin_rules-1.pdf\\nPAGE: 4\\nPASSAGE:\\nInterfering With Combat\\nYou can interfere with others’ combats in several ways, including: Use a one-shot card. You could help another player by using a one-shot to strengthen their side. Of course, you can “accidentally” strengthen the monster with it, instead. . .\\nPlay a monster enhancer. These cards (usually) make a monster stronger .. . and give it more Treasure. You can play these either during your own combats or during someone else's combat.\\nAdd a monster from your hand to join the combat, either with a Wandering Monster card or by using the special Undead rule.\\nBackstab a player in combat, if you're a Thief.\\nCurse them, if you have a Curse card.\\n\\nREWARDS\\nWhen you kill a monster, you get one level per monster, unless the monster card says something else, and you get all its Treasure! Each monster has a Treasure number on the bottom of its card. Draw that many Treasures, modified by any monster enhancers played on it. Draw face-down if you killed the monster alone. Draw face-up, so the whole party can see what you got, if someone helped you, even if they aren't taking any Treasures. (Sucker.)\\nIf you defeat a monster by nonlethal means, you do not get a level and you may or may not get the Treasure, depending on the method.\\nTreasure cards can be played as soon as you get them, even if you are the helper.\\n---\\n\\n\\n---\\nNAME: munchkin_rules/munch_4_rules_20thp.pdf\\nPAGE: 2\\nPASSAGE:\\nSTEEDS\\nDear to a munchkin’s heart (as of now) is his mighty Steed. Because, of course, it gives bonuses. Steeds are found in the Door deck.\\nNo player can have more than one Steed except by using a Cheat! card.\\nSteeds are Items, and follow normal Item rules. Anything that affects an Item can affect a Steed.\\nSteeds carry themselves. A Steed is “Big,” but it does not count against the number of Big items you can carry (in fact, some let you carry more Big things). The “Big” designation on Steeds is to control what Traps and Curses affect them, and to keep Thieves from pocketing them and walking off.\\nThere are a few Items that specifically enhance Steeds. Steeds cannot use Items unless the Item card specifically says so, and Item Enhancers don’t affect Steed-enhancing Items.\\nIf a Steed has a bonus or penalty to Run Away, that replaces the bonus of the rider. An Elf normally has a bonus to Run Away, but he has a penalty if he is riding the Turtle Steed! If your Steed gives you a penalty to Run Away, you may discard the Steed before you roll to flee. You don’t suffer the penalty, but the card goes to the discard pile.\\n\\nTreating Steeds as Monsters\\nA player who draws a face-up Steed may choose to treat it as a monster instead. In that case, its Level is equal to twice the combat bonus at the top of the card, and defeating it is good for one Treasure and one level. Monster Enhancers may be played on Steeds being fought as monsters, and have their normal effects. The Bad Stuff for any Steed attacked as a monster is “Lose a level.”\\n---\\n\",\n",
