You must defeat their combined combat strengths. Any special abilities, such as forcing you to fight with your Level only, apply to the entire fight. If you have the right cards, you can eliminate one monster from the combat and fight the other(s) normally, but you cannot choose to fight one and Run Away from the other(s). If you eliminate one monster, but then run from the other(s), you don’t get any levels or Treasure!\\n---\\n---\\nNAME: munchkin_rules/munchkin_rules-1.pdf\\nPAGE: 3\\nPASSAGE:\\nCOMBAT\\nTo fight a monster, compare its combat strength to yours. Combat strength is the total of Level plus all modifiers - positive or negative - given by Items and other cards. If the monster's combat strength is equal to yours, or greater, you lose the combat and must Run Away (see p. 5). If your combat strength totals more than the monster's — note that monsters win ties! — you kill it and goupa level (two levels for some big monsters). You'll also get the number of Treasures shown on its card.\\nSometimes a card will let you get rid of the monster without killing it. This is still “winning,” but you don't get a level. Unless the ability says otherwise, you don’t get the Treasures, either. If the last monster is removed from a combat, it ends instantly.\\nSome monster cards have special powers that affect combat — a bonus against a Race or Class, for instance. Be sure to check these!\\nYou and the other players may play one-shot Treasures or use Class or Race abilities to help or harm you in your combat. Some Door cards may also be played into a combat, such as monster enhancers (see below).\\nIf you kill a monster (or monsters!), discard the monster(s) and any other cards played, and claim your rewards. But note: someone may play a hostile card on you, or use a special power, just as you think you have won. When you kill a monster, you must wait a reasonable time, defined as about 2.6 seconds, for anyone else to speak up. After that, you have really killed the monster, and you really get the level(s) and Treasures, though they can still whine and argue.\\n---\\n---\\nNAME: munchkin_rules/munchkin_rules-1.pdf\\nPAGE: 2\\nPASSAGE:\\nCHARACTER STATS\\nEach character is basically a collection of weapons, armor, and magic items, with three stats: Level, Race, and Class. For instance, you might describe your character as a “Level 8 Elf Wizard with Boots of Butt-Kicking, a Staff of Napalm, and the Kneepads of Allure.” Level: This is a measure of how generally buff and studly you are. When the rules or cards refer to your Level, capitalized, they mean this number. You gain a level when you kill a monster, or when a card says that you do. You can also sell Items to buy levels (see Items). You lose a level when a card says you do. Your Level can never go below 1. However, your combat strength can be negative, if you get hit by a Curse or suffer some other kind of penalty.\\nClass: Characters may be Warriors, Wizards, Thieves, or Clerics. If you have no Class card in front of you, you have no class. Yeah, I know, we did that one already.\\nEach Class has special abilities, shown on the cards. You gain the abilities of a Class the moment you play its card in front of you, and lose them as soon as you discard that card. Some Class abilities are powered by discards. You may discard any card, in play or in your hand, to power a special ability.\\nSee the Class cards for when abilities can be used. Note that a Thief cannot steal while he or the target is fighting - and as soon as a monster is revealed, the fight is on!\\nYou can discard a Class card at any time, even in combat: “I don't wanna be a wizard anymore.” When you discard a Class card, you become classless until you play another Class card.\\nYou may not belong to more than one class at once unless you play the Super Munchkin card.\\nRace: Characters may be Humans, Elves, Dwarves, or Halflings. If you have no Race card in front of you, you are human.\\n---\\n---\\nNAME: munchkin_rules/munchkin_rules-1.pdf\\nPAGE: 4\\nPASSAGE:\\nInterfering With Combat\\nYou can interfere with others’ combats in several ways, including: Use a one-shot card. You could help another player by using a one-shot to strengthen their side. Of course, you can “accidentally” strengthen the monster with it, instead. . .\\nPlay a monster enhancer. These cards (usually) make a monster stronger .. . and give it more Treasure. You can play these either during your own combats or during someone else's combat.\\nAdd a monster from your hand to join the combat, either with a Wandering Monster card or by using the special Undead rule.\\nBackstab a player in combat, if you're a Thief.\\nCurse them, if you have a Curse card.\\n\\nREWARDS\\nWhen you kill a monster, you get one level per monster, unless the monster card says something else, and you get all its Treasure! Each monster has a Treasure number on the bottom of its card. Draw that many Treasures, modified by any monster enhancers played on it. Draw face-down if you killed the monster alone. Draw face-up, so the whole party can see what you got, if someone helped you, even if they aren't taking any Treasures. (Sucker.)\\nIf you defeat a monster by nonlethal means, you do not get a level and you may or may not get the Treasure, depending on the method.\\nTreasure cards can be played as soon as you get them, even if you are the helper.\\n---\\n---\\nNAME: munchkin_rules/munch_4_rules_20thp.pdf\\nPAGE: 2\\nPASSAGE:\\nSTEEDS\\nDear to a munchkin’s heart (as of now) is his mighty Steed. Because, of course, it gives bonuses. Steeds are found in the Door deck.\\nNo player can have more than one Steed except by using a Cheat! card.\\nSteeds are Items, and follow normal Item rules. Anything that affects an Item can affect a Steed.\\nSteeds carry themselves. A Steed is “Big,” but it does not count against the number of Big items you can carry (in fact, some let you carry more Big things). The “Big” designation on Steeds is to control what Traps and Curses affect them, and to keep Thieves from pocketing them and walking off.\\nThere are a few Items that specifically enhance Steeds. Steeds cannot use Items unless the Item card specifically says so, and Item Enhancers don’t affect Steed-enhancing Items.\\nIf a Steed has a bonus or penalty to Run Away, that replaces the bonus of the rider. An Elf normally has a bonus to Run Away, but he has a penalty if he is riding the Turtle Steed! If your Steed gives you a penalty to Run Away, you may discard the Steed before you roll to flee. You don’t suffer the penalty, but the card goes to the discard pile.\\n\\nTreating Steeds as Monsters\\nA player who draws a face-up Steed may choose to treat it as a monster instead. In that case, its Level is equal to twice the combat bonus at the top of the card, and defeating it is good for one Treasure and one level. Monster Enhancers may be played on Steeds being fought as monsters, and have their normal effects. The Bad Stuff for any Steed attacked as a monster is “Lose a level.”\\n---\\n---\\nNAME: munchkin_rules/munchkin_rules-1.pdf\\nPAGE: 5\\nPASSAGE:\\nDEATH\\nIf you die, you lose all your stuff. You keep your Class(es), Race(s), and Level (and any Curses that were affecting you when you died) - your new character will look just like your old one. If you have Half-Breed or Super Munchkin, keep those as well.\\nOnce you have died, you don’t have to Run Away from any remaining monsters.\\nLooting The Body: Lay out your hand beside the cards you had in play (making sure not to include the cards mentioned above). If you have an Item carried bya Hireling or attached to a Cheat! card, separate those cards. Starting with the player with the highest Level, everyone else chooses one card . . . in case of ties in Level, roll a die. Once everyone gets one card, discard the rest. If your corpse runs out of cards, tough. Looted cards go into players’ hands.\\nDead characters cannot receive cards for any reason, not even Charity, and cannot level up or win the game.\\nWhen the next player begins their turn, your newly revived character appears and can help others in combat with your Level and Class or Race abilities . . . but you have no cards, unless you receive Charity or gifts from other players.\\nOn your next turn, start by drawing four face-down cards from each deck and playing any legal cards you want to, just as when you started the game. Then take your turn normally.\\n---\\n----\\n\\nQuestion: Can I play a Go Up a Level card during combat?\\nLet's think step by step.\"\n",

Because, of course, it gives bonuses. Steeds are found in the Door deck.\\nNo player can have more than one Steed except by using a Cheat! card.\\nSteeds are Items, and follow normal Item rules. Anything that affects an Item can affect a Steed.\\nSteeds carry themselves. A Steed is “Big,” but it does not count against the number of Big items you can carry (in fact, some let you carry more Big things). The “Big” designation on Steeds is to control what Traps and Curses affect them, and to keep Thieves from pocketing them and walking off.\\nThere are a few Items that specifically enhance Steeds. Steeds cannot use Items unless the Item card specifically says so, and Item Enhancers don’t affect Steed-enhancing Items.\\nIf a Steed has a bonus or penalty to Run Away, that replaces the bonus of the rider. An Elf normally has a bonus to Run Away, but he has a penalty if he is riding the Turtle Steed! If your Steed gives you a penalty to Run Away, you may discard the Steed before you roll to flee. You don’t suffer the penalty, but the card goes to the discard pile.\\n\\nTreating Steeds as Monsters\\nA player who draws a face-up Steed may choose to treat it as a monster instead. In that case, its Level is equal to twice the combat bonus at the top of the card, and defeating it is good for one Treasure and one level. Monster Enhancers may be played on Steeds being fought as monsters, and have their normal effects. The Bad Stuff for any Steed attacked as a monster is “Lose a level.”\\n---\\n---\\nNAME: munchkin_rules/munchkin_rules-1.pdf\\nPAGE: 5\\nPASSAGE:\\nDEATH\\nIf you die, you lose all your stuff. You keep your Class(es), Race(s), and Level (and any Curses that were affecting you when you died) - your new character will look just like your old one. If you have Half-Breed or Super Munchkin, keep those as well.\\nOnce you have died, you don’t have to Run Away from any remaining monsters.\\nLooting The Body: Lay out your hand beside the cards you had in play (making sure not to include the cards mentioned above). If you have an Item carried bya Hireling or attached to a Cheat! card, separate those cards. Starting with the player with the highest Level, everyone else chooses one card . . . in case of ties in Level, roll a die. Once everyone gets one card, discard the rest. If your corpse runs out of cards, tough. Looted cards go into players’ hands.\\nDead characters cannot receive cards for any reason, not even Charity, and cannot level up or win the game.\\nWhen the next player begins their turn, your newly revived character appears and can help others in combat with your Level and Class or Race abilities . . . but you have no cards, unless you receive Charity or gifts from other players.\\nOn your next turn, start by drawing four face-down cards from each deck and playing any legal cards you want to, just as when you started the game. Then take your turn normally.\\n---\\n----\\n\\nQuestion: Can I play a Go Up a Level card during combat?\\nLet's think step by step.\\n\\nAI: content='Yes, you can play a Go Up a Level card during combat. According to the rules provided, \\\"Go Upa Level cards may be played on yourself or any other player at any time, even during combat.

Most of these are used during combat to strengthen the munchkins or the monsters, and may be played from your hand or from the table. Some have other effects, however, so read the card carefully! Discard these cards as soon as the combat is over or their effect is resolved.\\nOne-shot Items with a Gold Piece value may be sold for levels, just like other Items.\\n\\nOTHER TREASURES\\nOther Treasure cards (like Go Up a Level cards) are not Items. Most of these cards say when they can be played, and whether they stay in play or are discarded. A couple of specific examples: Go Upa Level cards may be played on yourself or any other player at any time, even during combat. Discard them once they are played. Exception: You cannot play a Go Up a Level card to give a player the winning level!\\nHireling may be played at any time, on any turn. You cannot give a Hireling an Item to carry while you are in combat, however.\\n---\\n---\\nNAME: munchkin_rules/munchkin_rules-1.pdf\\nPAGE: 1\\nPASSAGE:\\nConflicts Between Cards and Rules\\nThis rulesheet gives the general tules. Many cards add special rules, so in most cases when the rulesheet disagrees with a card, follow the card. However, ignore any card effect that might seem to contradict one of the rules listed below unless the card explicitly says it supersedes that rule!\\niL Nothing can reduce a player below Level 1, although card effects might reduce a player's or a monster's combat strength (p. 3) below I.\\n2. You go up a level after combat only if you Ail a monster.\\n3. You cannot collect rewards for defeating a monster (eg., Treasure, levels) in the middle of a combat. You must finish the fight before gaining any rewards.\\n4. You must killa monster to reach Level 10, and you cannot force another player to help you do it.\\nAny other disputes should be settled by loud arguments, with the owner of the game having the last word. You could also read the Munchkin FAQ and errata pages at munchkin.game, or start a discussion at forums.sjgames.com/, munchkin . . . unless it’s more fun to argue.\\n\\nSTEVE JACKSON GAMES\\nYour Hand: Cards in your hand are not in play. They don’t help you, but they can’t be taken away except by cards that specifically affect “your hand.” At the end of your turn, you may have no more than five cards in your hand (see Charity, p- 2).\\nCards in play may not be returned to your hand - they must be discarded or traded if you want to get rid of them.\\n---\\n---\\nNAME: munchkin_rules/munchkin_rules-1.pdf\\nPAGE: 2\\nPASSAGE:\\nWhen You May Take Actions\\nYou may perform these actions at any time: & Discard a Class or Race.\\n& Play a Go Up a Level or Hireling. Play a Curse.\\nYou may perform these actions at any time, as long as you are not in combat: Trade an Item with another player (the other player may not be in combat, either).\\ny Change which Items you have equipped.\\nPlay a card that you have just received (some cards may be played even during combat; see above).\\nYou may perform these actions on your own turn: 3 Play a new Class or Race card (at any time).\\nwe Sell Items for levels (except when you are in combat). Play an Item (most Items cannot be played during combat, but some one-shot Items can; see p- 3).\\n---\\n---\\nNAME: munchkin_rules/munchkin_rules-1.pdf\\nPAGE: 4\\nPASSAGE:\\nMONSTERS\\nIf drawn face-up, during the Kick Open The Door phase, monsters immediately attack the person who drew them.\\nIf you get a monster card any other way, it goes into your hand and may be played during your own turn to Look For Trouble, or played to join another player's fight with the Wandering Monster card. (See Fighting Multiple Monsters, below.)\\nEach monster card is a single monster, even if the name on the card is plural. had ) , ‘y\\n\\nMONSTER ENHANCERS\\nCertain cards, called monster enhancers, raise or lower the combat strength of individual monsters. (Penalties to monsters are still considered enhancers.) They also affect the number of Treasures the monsters are worth. monster enhancers may be played by any player during any combat.\\nAll enhancers on a single monster add together. If there are multiple monsters in a combat, the person who plays each enhancer must choose which monster it applies to.\\nException: Anything that enhances a monster also enhances its Mate . . . if Ancient, Enraged, and Mate are played ona single monster, in any order, you are facing an Ancient Enraged monster and its Ancient Enraged Mate.\\n\\nGood luck .. .\\n\\nFIGHTING MULTIPLE MONSTERS\\nSome cards (such as Wandering Monster) allow your rivals to send other monsters to join the fight. You must defeat their combined combat strengths. Any special abilities, such as forcing you to fight with your Level only, apply to the entire fight. If you have the right cards, you can eliminate one monster from the combat and fight the other(s) normally, but you cannot choose to fight one and Run Away from the other(s). If you eliminate one monster, but then run from the other(s), you don’t get any levels or Treasure!\\n---\\n---\\nNAME: munchkin_rules/munchkin_rules-1.pdf\\nPAGE: 3\\nPASSAGE:\\nCOMBAT\\nTo fight a monster, compare its combat strength to yours. Combat strength is the total of Level plus all modifiers - positive or negative - given by Items and other cards. If the monster's combat strength is equal to yours, or greater, you lose the combat and must Run Away (see p. 5). If your combat strength totals more than the monster's — note that monsters win ties! — you kill it and goupa level (two levels for some big monsters). You'll also get the number of Treasures shown on its card.\\nSometimes a card will let you get rid of the monster without killing it. This is still “winning,” but you don't get a level. Unless the ability says otherwise, you don’t get the Treasures, either. If the last monster is removed from a combat, it ends instantly.\\nSome monster cards have special powers that affect combat — a bonus against a Race or Class, for instance. Be sure to check these!\\nYou and the other players may play one-shot Treasures or use Class or Race abilities to help or harm you in your combat. Some Door cards may also be played into a combat, such as monster enhancers (see below).\\nIf you kill a monster (or monsters!), discard the monster(s) and any other cards played, and claim your rewards. But note: someone may play a hostile card on you, or use a special power, just as you think you have won. When you kill a monster, you must wait a reasonable time, defined as about 2.6 seconds, for anyone else to speak up. After that, you have really killed the monster, and you really get the level(s) and Treasures, though they can still whine and argue.\\n---\\n---\\nNAME: munchkin_rules/munchkin_rules-1.pdf\\nPAGE: 2\\nPASSAGE:\\nCHARACTER STATS\\nEach character is basically a collection of weapons, armor, and magic items, with three stats: Level, Race, and Class. For instance, you might describe your character as a “Level 8 Elf Wizard with Boots of Butt-Kicking, a Staff of Napalm, and the Kneepads of Allure.” Level: This is a measure of how generally buff and studly you are. When the rules or cards refer to your Level, capitalized, they mean this number. You gain a level when you kill a monster, or when a card says that you do. You can also sell Items to buy levels (see Items). You lose a level when a card says you do. Your Level can never go below 1. However, your combat strength can be negative, if you get hit by a Curse or suffer some other kind of penalty.\\nClass: Characters may be Warriors, Wizards, Thieves, or Clerics. If you have no Class card in front of you, you have no class. Yeah, I know, we did that one already.\\nEach Class has special abilities, shown on the cards. You gain the abilities of a Class the moment you play its card in front of you, and lose them as soon as you discard that card. Some Class abilities are powered by discards. You may discard any card, in play or in your hand, to power a special ability.\\nSee the Class cards for when abilities can be used. Note that a Thief cannot steal while he or the target is fighting - and as soon as a monster is revealed, the fight is on!\\nYou can discard a Class card at any time, even in combat: “I don't wanna be a wizard anymore.” When you discard a Class card, you become classless until you play another Class card.\\nYou may not belong to more than one class at once unless you play the Super Munchkin card.\\nRace: Characters may be Humans, Elves, Dwarves, or Halflings. If you have no Race card in front of you, you are human.\\n---\\n---\\nNAME: munchkin_rules/munchkin_rules-1.pdf\\nPAGE: 4\\nPASSAGE:\\nInterfering With Combat\\nYou can interfere with others’ combats in several ways, including: Use a one-shot card. You could help another player by using a one-shot to strengthen their side. Of course, you can “accidentally” strengthen the monster with it, instead. . .\\nPlay a monster enhancer. These cards (usually) make a monster stronger .. . and give it more Treasure. You can play these either during your own combats or during someone else's combat.\\nAdd a monster from your hand to join the combat, either with a Wandering Monster card or by using the special Undead rule.\\nBackstab a player in combat, if you're a Thief.\\nCurse them, if you have a Curse card.\\n\\nREWARDS\\nWhen you kill a monster, you get one level per monster, unless the monster card says something else, and you get all its Treasure! Each monster has a Treasure number on the bottom of its card. Draw that many Treasures, modified by any monster enhancers played on it. Draw face-down if you killed the monster alone. Draw face-up, so the whole party can see what you got, if someone helped you, even if they aren't taking any Treasures. (Sucker.)\\nIf you defeat a monster by nonlethal means, you do not get a level and you may or may not get the Treasure, depending on the method.\\nTreasure cards can be played as soon as you get them, even if you are the helper.\\n---\\n---\\nNAME: munchkin_rules/munch_4_rules_20thp.pdf\\nPAGE: 2\\nPASSAGE:\\nSTEEDS\\nDear to a munchkin’s heart (as of now) is his mighty Steed. Because, of course, it gives bonuses. Steeds are found in the Door deck.\\nNo player can have more than one Steed except by using a Cheat! card.\\nSteeds are Items, and follow normal Item rules. Anything that affects an Item can affect a Steed.\\nSteeds carry themselves. A Steed is “Big,” but it does not count against the number of Big items you can carry (in fact, some let you carry more Big things). The “Big” designation on Steeds is to control what Traps and Curses affect them, and to keep Thieves from pocketing them and walking off.\\nThere are a few Items that specifically enhance Steeds. Steeds cannot use Items unless the Item card specifically says so, and Item Enhancers don’t affect Steed-enhancing Items.\\nIf a Steed has a bonus or penalty to Run Away, that replaces the bonus of the rider. An Elf normally has a bonus to Run Away, but he has a penalty if he is riding the Turtle Steed! If your Steed gives you a penalty to Run Away, you may discard the Steed before you roll to flee. You don’t suffer the penalty, but the card goes to the discard pile.\\n\\nTreating Steeds as Monsters\\nA player who draws a face-up Steed may choose to treat it as a monster instead. In that case, its Level is equal to twice the combat bonus at the top of the card, and defeating it is good for one Treasure and one level. Monster Enhancers may be played on Steeds being fought as monsters, and have their normal effects. The Bad Stuff for any Steed attacked as a monster is “Lose a level.”\\n---\\n---\\nNAME: munchkin_rules/munchkin_rules-1.pdf\\nPAGE: 5\\nPASSAGE:\\nDEATH\\nIf you die, you lose all your stuff. You keep your Class(es), Race(s), and Level (and any Curses that were affecting you when you died) - your new character will look just like your old one. If you have Half-Breed or Super Munchkin, keep those as well.\\nOnce you have died, you don’t have to Run Away from any remaining monsters.\\nLooting The Body: Lay out your hand beside the cards you had in play (making sure not to include the cards mentioned above). If you have an Item carried bya Hireling or attached to a Cheat! card, separate those cards. Starting with the player with the highest Level, everyone else chooses one card . . . in case of ties in Level, roll a die. Once everyone gets one card, discard the rest. If your corpse runs out of cards, tough. Looted cards go into players’ hands.\\nDead characters cannot receive cards for any reason, not even Charity, and cannot level up or win the game.\\nWhen the next player begins their turn, your newly revived character appears and can help others in combat with your Level and Class or Race abilities . . . but you have no cards, unless you receive Charity or gifts from other players.\\nOn your next turn, start by drawing four face-down cards from each deck and playing any legal cards you want to, just as when you started the game. Then take your turn normally.\\n---\\n----\\n\\nQ: Can I play a Go Up a Level card during combat?\\nWalk me through this context in manageable parts step by step, summarizing and analyzing as we go.\"\n",

If you have the right cards, you can eliminate one monster from the combat and fight the other(s) normally, but you cannot choose to fight one and Run Away from the other(s). If you eliminate one monster, but then run from the other(s), you don’t get any levels or Treasure!\\n---\\n---\\nNAME: munchkin_rules/munchkin_rules-1.pdf\\nPAGE: 3\\nPASSAGE:\\nCOMBAT\\nTo fight a monster, compare its combat strength to yours. Combat strength is the total of Level plus all modifiers - positive or negative - given by Items and other cards. If the monster's combat strength is equal to yours, or greater, you lose the combat and must Run Away (see p. 5). If your combat strength totals more than the monster's — note that monsters win ties! — you kill it and goupa level (two levels for some big monsters). You'll also get the number of Treasures shown on its card.\\nSometimes a card will let you get rid of the monster without killing it. This is still “winning,” but you don't get a level. Unless the ability says otherwise, you don’t get the Treasures, either. If the last monster is removed from a combat, it ends instantly.\\nSome monster cards have special powers that affect combat — a bonus against a Race or Class, for instance. Be sure to check these!\\nYou and the other players may play one-shot Treasures or use Class or Race abilities to help or harm you in your combat. Some Door cards may also be played into a combat, such as monster enhancers (see below).\\nIf you kill a monster (or monsters!), discard the monster(s) and any other cards played, and claim your rewards. But note: someone may play a hostile card on you, or use a special power, just as you think you have won. When you kill a monster, you must wait a reasonable time, defined as about 2.6 seconds, for anyone else to speak up. After that, you have really killed the monster, and you really get the level(s) and Treasures, though they can still whine and argue.\\n---\\n---\\nNAME: munchkin_rules/munchkin_rules-1.pdf\\nPAGE: 2\\nPASSAGE:\\nCHARACTER STATS\\nEach character is basically a collection of weapons, armor, and magic items, with three stats: Level, Race, and Class. For instance, you might describe your character as a “Level 8 Elf Wizard with Boots of Butt-Kicking, a Staff of Napalm, and the Kneepads of Allure.” Level: This is a measure of how generally buff and studly you are. When the rules or cards refer to your Level, capitalized, they mean this number. You gain a level when you kill a monster, or when a card says that you do. You can also sell Items to buy levels (see Items). You lose a level when a card says you do. Your Level can never go below 1. However, your combat strength can be negative, if you get hit by a Curse or suffer some other kind of penalty.\\nClass: Characters may be Warriors, Wizards, Thieves, or Clerics. If you have no Class card in front of you, you have no class. Yeah, I know, we did that one already.\\nEach Class has special abilities, shown on the cards. You gain the abilities of a Class the moment you play its card in front of you, and lose them as soon as you discard that card. Some Class abilities are powered by discards. You may discard any card, in play or in your hand, to power a special ability.\\nSee the Class cards for when abilities can be used. Note that a Thief cannot steal while he or the target is fighting - and as soon as a monster is revealed, the fight is on!\\nYou can discard a Class card at any time, even in combat: “I don't wanna be a wizard anymore.” When you discard a Class card, you become classless until you play another Class card.\\nYou may not belong to more than one class at once unless you play the Super Munchkin card.\\nRace: Characters may be Humans, Elves, Dwarves, or Halflings. If you have no Race card in front of you, you are human.\\n---\\n---\\nNAME: munchkin_rules/munchkin_rules-1.pdf\\nPAGE: 4\\nPASSAGE:\\nInterfering With Combat\\nYou can interfere with others’ combats in several ways, including: Use a one-shot card. You could help another player by using a one-shot to strengthen their side. Of course, you can “accidentally” strengthen the monster with it, instead. . .\\nPlay a monster enhancer. These cards (usually) make a monster stronger .. . and give it more Treasure. You can play these either during your own combats or during someone else's combat.\\nAdd a monster from your hand to join the combat, either with a Wandering Monster card or by using the special Undead rule.\\nBackstab a player in combat, if you're a Thief.\\nCurse them, if you have a Curse card.\\n\\nREWARDS\\nWhen you kill a monster, you get one level per monster, unless the monster card says something else, and you get all its Treasure! Each monster has a Treasure number on the bottom of its card. Draw that many Treasures, modified by any monster enhancers played on it. Draw face-down if you killed the monster alone. Draw face-up, so the whole party can see what you got, if someone helped you, even if they aren't taking any Treasures. (Sucker.)\\nIf you defeat a monster by nonlethal means, you do not get a level and you may or may not get the Treasure, depending on the method.\\nTreasure cards can be played as soon as you get them, even if you are the helper.\\n---\\n---\\nNAME: munchkin_rules/munch_4_rules_20thp.pdf\\nPAGE: 2\\nPASSAGE:\\nSTEEDS\\nDear to a munchkin’s heart (as of now) is his mighty Steed.

Anything that affects an Item can affect a Steed.\\nSteeds carry themselves. A Steed is “Big,” but it does not count against the number of Big items you can carry (in fact, some let you carry more Big things). The “Big” designation on Steeds is to control what Traps and Curses affect them, and to keep Thieves from pocketing them and walking off.\\nThere are a few Items that specifically enhance Steeds. Steeds cannot use Items unless the Item card specifically says so, and Item Enhancers don’t affect Steed-enhancing Items.\\nIf a Steed has a bonus or penalty to Run Away, that replaces the bonus of the rider. An Elf normally has a bonus to Run Away, but he has a penalty if he is riding the Turtle Steed! If your Steed gives you a penalty to Run Away, you may discard the Steed before you roll to flee. You don’t suffer the penalty, but the card goes to the discard pile.\\n\\nTreating Steeds as Monsters\\nA player who draws a face-up Steed may choose to treat it as a monster instead. In that case, its Level is equal to twice the combat bonus at the top of the card, and defeating it is good for one Treasure and one level. Monster Enhancers may be played on Steeds being fought as monsters, and have their normal effects. The Bad Stuff for any Steed attacked as a monster is “Lose a level.”\\n---\\n---\\nNAME: munchkin_rules/munchkin_rules-1.pdf\\nPAGE: 5\\nPASSAGE:\\nDEATH\\nIf you die, you lose all your stuff. You keep your Class(es), Race(s), and Level (and any Curses that were affecting you when you died) - your new character will look just like your old one. If you have Half-Breed or Super Munchkin, keep those as well.\\nOnce you have died, you don’t have to Run Away from any remaining monsters.\\nLooting The Body: Lay out your hand beside the cards you had in play (making sure not to include the cards mentioned above). If you have an Item carried bya Hireling or attached to a Cheat! card, separate those cards. Starting with the player with the highest Level, everyone else chooses one card . . . in case of ties in Level, roll a die. Once everyone gets one card, discard the rest. If your corpse runs out of cards, tough. Looted cards go into players’ hands.\\nDead characters cannot receive cards for any reason, not even Charity, and cannot level up or win the game.\\nWhen the next player begins their turn, your newly revived character appears and can help others in combat with your Level and Class or Race abilities . . . but you have no cards, unless you receive Charity or gifts from other players.\\nOn your next turn, start by drawing four face-down cards from each deck and playing any legal cards you want to, just as when you started the game. Then take your turn normally.\\n---\\n----\\n\\nQ: Can I play a Go Up a Level card during combat?\\nWalk me through this context in manageable parts step by step, summarizing and analyzing as we go.\\n\\nAI: content='In the given context, we can find the answer to the question \\\"Can I play a Go Up a Level card during combat?\\\" by examining the relevant passages.\\\\n\\\\n1. In the passage on page 2, under \\\"Actions you may perform at any time,\\\" it is stated that players can play a Go Up a Level card during their turn.\\\\n2. In the passage on page 3, under \\\"COMBAT,\\\" it is mentioned that players can play one-shot Treasures or use Class or Race abilities to help or harm you in your combat.

Most of these are used during combat to strengthen the munchkins or the monsters, and may be played from your hand or from the table. Some have other effects, however, so read the card carefully! Discard these cards as soon as the combat is over or their effect is resolved.\\nOne-shot Items with a Gold Piece value may be sold for levels, just like other Items.\\n\\nOTHER TREASURES\\nOther Treasure cards (like Go Up a Level cards) are not Items. Most of these cards say when they can be played, and whether they stay in play or are discarded. A couple of specific examples: Go Upa Level cards may be played on yourself or any other player at any time, even during combat. Discard them once they are played. Exception: You cannot play a Go Up a Level card to give a player the winning level!\\nHireling may be played at any time, on any turn. You cannot give a Hireling an Item to carry while you are in combat, however.\\n---\\n---\\nNAME: munchkin_rules/munchkin_rules-1.pdf\\nPAGE: 1\\nPASSAGE:\\nConflicts Between Cards and Rules\\nThis rulesheet gives the general tules. Many cards add special rules, so in most cases when the rulesheet disagrees with a card, follow the card. However, ignore any card effect that might seem to contradict one of the rules listed below unless the card explicitly says it supersedes that rule!\\niL Nothing can reduce a player below Level 1, although card effects might reduce a player's or a monster's combat strength (p. 3) below I.\\n2. You go up a level after combat only if you Ail a monster.\\n3. You cannot collect rewards for defeating a monster (eg., Treasure, levels) in the middle of a combat. You must finish the fight before gaining any rewards.\\n4. You must killa monster to reach Level 10, and you cannot force another player to help you do it.\\nAny other disputes should be settled by loud arguments, with the owner of the game having the last word. You could also read the Munchkin FAQ and errata pages at munchkin.game, or start a discussion at forums.sjgames.com/, munchkin . . . unless it’s more fun to argue.\\n\\nSTEVE JACKSON GAMES\\nYour Hand: Cards in your hand are not in play. They don’t help you, but they can’t be taken away except by cards that specifically affect “your hand.” At the end of your turn, you may have no more than five cards in your hand (see Charity, p- 2).\\nCards in play may not be returned to your hand - they must be discarded or traded if you want to get rid of them.\\n---\\n---\\nNAME: munchkin_rules/munchkin_rules-1.pdf\\nPAGE: 2\\nPASSAGE:\\nWhen You May Take Actions\\nYou may perform these actions at any time: & Discard a Class or Race.\\n& Play a Go Up a Level or Hireling. Play a Curse.\\nYou may perform these actions at any time, as long as you are not in combat: Trade an Item with another player (the other player may not be in combat, either).\\ny Change which Items you have equipped.\\nPlay a card that you have just received (some cards may be played even during combat; see above).\\nYou may perform these actions on your own turn: 3 Play a new Class or Race card (at any time).\\nwe Sell Items for levels (except when you are in combat). Play an Item (most Items cannot be played during combat, but some one-shot Items can; see p- 3).\\n---\\n---\\nNAME: munchkin_rules/munchkin_rules-1.pdf\\nPAGE: 4\\nPASSAGE:\\nMONSTERS\\nIf drawn face-up, during the Kick Open The Door phase, monsters immediately attack the person who drew them.\\nIf you get a monster card any other way, it goes into your hand and may be played during your own turn to Look For Trouble, or played to join another player's fight with the Wandering Monster card. (See Fighting Multiple Monsters, below.)\\nEach monster card is a single monster, even if the name on the card is plural. had ) , ‘y\\n\\nMONSTER ENHANCERS\\nCertain cards, called monster enhancers, raise or lower the combat strength of individual monsters. (Penalties to monsters are still considered enhancers.) They also affect the number of Treasures the monsters are worth. monster enhancers may be played by any player during any combat.\\nAll enhancers on a single monster add together. If there are multiple monsters in a combat, the person who plays each enhancer must choose which monster it applies to.\\nException: Anything that enhances a monster also enhances its Mate . . . if Ancient, Enraged, and Mate are played ona single monster, in any order, you are facing an Ancient Enraged monster and its Ancient Enraged Mate.\\n\\nGood luck .. .\\n\\nFIGHTING MULTIPLE MONSTERS\\nSome cards (such as Wandering Monster) allow your rivals to send other monsters to join the fight. You must defeat their combined combat strengths. Any special abilities, such as forcing you to fight with your Level only, apply to the entire fight. If you have the right cards, you can eliminate one monster from the combat and fight the other(s) normally, but you cannot choose to fight one and Run Away from the other(s). If you eliminate one monster, but then run from the other(s), you don’t get any levels or Treasure!\\n---\\n---\\nNAME: munchkin_rules/munchkin_rules-1.pdf\\nPAGE: 3\\nPASSAGE:\\nCOMBAT\\nTo fight a monster, compare its combat strength to yours. Combat strength is the total of Level plus all modifiers - positive or negative - given by Items and other cards. If the monster's combat strength is equal to yours, or greater, you lose the combat and must Run Away (see p. 5). If your combat strength totals more than the monster's — note that monsters win ties! — you kill it and goupa level (two levels for some big monsters). You'll also get the number of Treasures shown on its card.\\nSometimes a card will let you get rid of the monster without killing it. This is still “winning,” but you don't get a level. Unless the ability says otherwise, you don’t get the Treasures, either. If the last monster is removed from a combat, it ends instantly.\\nSome monster cards have special powers that affect combat — a bonus against a Race or Class, for instance. Be sure to check these!\\nYou and the other players may play one-shot Treasures or use Class or Race abilities to help or harm you in your combat. Some Door cards may also be played into a combat, such as monster enhancers (see below).\\nIf you kill a monster (or monsters!), discard the monster(s) and any other cards played, and claim your rewards. But note: someone may play a hostile card on you, or use a special power, just as you think you have won. When you kill a monster, you must wait a reasonable time, defined as about 2.6 seconds, for anyone else to speak up. After that, you have really killed the monster, and you really get the level(s) and Treasures, though they can still whine and argue.\\n---\\n----\\n\\nQ: Can I play a Go Up a Level card during combat?\\nWalk me through this context in manageable parts step by step, summarizing and analyzing as we go.\"\n",

You must defeat their combined combat strengths. Any special abilities, such as forcing you to fight with your Level only, apply to the entire fight. If you have the right cards, you can eliminate one monster from the combat and fight the other(s) normally, but you cannot choose to fight one and Run Away from the other(s).

Combat strength is the total of Level plus all modifiers - positive or negative - given by Items and other cards. If the monster's combat strength is equal to yours, or greater, you lose the combat and must Run Away (see p. 5). If your combat strength totals more than the monster's — note that monsters win ties! — you kill it and goupa level (two levels for some big monsters). You'll also get the number of Treasures shown on its card.\\nSometimes a card will let you get rid of the monster without killing it. This is still “winning,” but you don't get a level. Unless the ability says otherwise, you don’t get the Treasures, either. If the last monster is removed from a combat, it ends instantly.\\nSome monster cards have special powers that affect combat — a bonus against a Race or Class, for instance. Be sure to check these!\\nYou and the other players may play one-shot Treasures or use Class or Race abilities to help or harm you in your combat. Some Door cards may also be played into a combat, such as monster enhancers (see below).\\nIf you kill a monster (or monsters!), discard the monster(s) and any other cards played, and claim your rewards. But note: someone may play a hostile card on you, or use a special power, just as you think you have won. When you kill a monster, you must wait a reasonable time, defined as about 2.6 seconds, for anyone else to speak up. After that, you have really killed the monster, and you really get the level(s) and Treasures, though they can still whine and argue.\\n---\\n----\\n\\nQ: Can I play a Go Up a Level card during combat?\\nWalk me through this context in manageable parts step by step, summarizing and analyzing as we go.\\n\\nAI: content=\\\"To answer the question about whether you can play a Go Up a Level card during combat, let's analyze the context in manageable parts:\\\\n\\\\n1. The rules for One-shot Treasures and other Treasures are provided. The passage doesn't mention Go Up a Level cards in this section.\\\\n\\\\n2. The passage on conflicts between cards and rules specifies that in most cases, card effects override the rulesheet, with some exceptions. However, there is no mention of Go Up a Level cards in this section.\\\\n\\\\n3. The rules on what you can do with cards in your hand and cards in play are provided. Again, there is no mention of Go Up a Level cards in these sections.\\\\n\\\\n4. The section on when you may take actions specifies that you can play a Go Up a Level or Hireling during combat. This suggests that you can play a Go Up a Level card during combat.\\\\n\\\\n5. The passage on monster enhancers states that monster enhancers may be played by any player during any combat. Since Go Up a Level cards are not classified as monster enhancers, the rule for playing monster enhancers doesn't apply to Go Up a Level cards.\\\\n\\\\n6. The rules for fighting multiple monsters state that you must defeat the combined combat strengths of all monsters in play. No restriction on using Go Up a Level cards is mentioned in this section.\\\\n\\\\n7. The combat rules specify that you fight a monster by comparing your combat strength to its combat strength. There is no restriction on playing Go Up a Level cards during this process.\\\\n\\\\nBased on the information provided, we can conclude that you can play a Go Up a Level card during combat, as it is specifically mentioned in the section on actions you can take during combat.\\\"\\nHuman: Now revise your answer.

If you eliminate one monster, but then run from the other(s), you don’t get any levels or Treasure!\\n---\\n---\\nNAME: munchkin_rules/munchkin_rules-1.pdf\\nPAGE: 3\\nPASSAGE:\\nCOMBAT\\nTo fight a monster, compare its combat strength to yours. Combat strength is the total of Level plus all modifiers - positive or negative - given by Items and other cards. If the monster's combat strength is equal to yours, or greater, you lose the combat and must Run Away (see p. 5). If your combat strength totals more than the monster's — note that monsters win ties! — you kill it and goupa level (two levels for some big monsters). You'll also get the number of Treasures shown on its card.\\nSometimes a card will let you get rid of the monster without killing it. This is still “winning,” but you don't get a level. Unless the ability says otherwise, you don’t get the Treasures, either. If the last monster is removed from a combat, it ends instantly.\\nSome monster cards have special powers that affect combat — a bonus against a Race or Class, for instance. Be sure to check these!\\nYou and the other players may play one-shot Treasures or use Class or Race abilities to help or harm you in your combat. Some Door cards may also be played into a combat, such as monster enhancers (see below).\\nIf you kill a monster (or monsters!), discard the monster(s) and any other cards played, and claim your rewards. But note: someone may play a hostile card on you, or use a special power, just as you think you have won. When you kill a monster, you must wait a reasonable time, defined as about 2.6 seconds, for anyone else to speak up. After that, you have really killed the monster, and you really get the level(s) and Treasures, though they can still whine and argue.\\n---\\n----\\n\\nQ: Can I play a Go Up a Level card during combat?\\nWalk me through this context in manageable parts step by step, summarizing and analyzing as we go.\\n\\nAI: content='Part 1: Go Up a Level cards\\\\nThe passage on page 3 of the rules states that \\\"Go Upa Level cards may be played on yourself or any other player at any time, even during combat.

    "STUDENT ANSWER: A player can carry multiple big items, including Steeds, but only one can be equipped. If a player loses the ability to have more than one big item, they must correct the issue or discard all but one big item.\n",
    "TRUE ANSWER: No. You can only carry one big item at a time.\n",

    "QUESTION: How many players can join me in a combat?\n",
    "STUDENT ANSWER: In Munchkin, during combat against a monster, other players can help by adding their combat strength. Multiple players can contribute monsters to a fight using the Wandering Monster card. The player fighting the monster must defeat the combined combat strength of all the joined monsters. However, the rules do not explicitly state a maximum number of players who can contribute monsters to join a combat.\n",
    "TRUE ANSWER: Only one player can join you in combat.\n",

    "TRUE ANSWER: No. When a hireling is removed from play due to bad stuff, any items the hireling was carrying are also removed from play.\n",
    "EXPLANATION: The student answer explains that if a Hireling is removed from play for any reason, the items the Hireling was carrying are lost and not retained by the player. The true answer states that when a hireling is removed from play due to bad stuff, the items carried by the hireling are also removed from play.

    "TRUE ANSWER: You can discard your Race card at any time.\n",

If the card is a curse - see Curses, p- Sait applies to you immediately (if it can) and is discarded (unless it has a persistent effect or you keep the card as a reminder of an upcoming effect).\\nIf you draw any other card, you may either put it in your hand or play it immediately.\\n(2) Look For Trouble/Loot The Room: If you fought a monster in phase IL, skip this phase and go to phase Be If you did NOT draw a monster when you first opened the door, you have two choices: either Look For Trouble or Loot The Room.\\nLook For Trouble: Play a monster from your hand and fight it, just as if you had found it when you kicked open the door. Don’t play a monster you can't handle, unless you're sure you can count on getting help (see p- 4)!\\nLoot The Room: Draw a second card from the Door deck, face down, and place it in your hand.\\n(3) Charity: If you have more than five cards in your hand, you must play enough cards to get you to five or below — for instance, you can play Curses, sell Items from your hand, or play Items to the table. If you cannot reduce your hand to five cards, or do not want to, you must give the excess cards to the player with the lowest Level. If players are tied for lowest, divide the cards as evenly as possible, but it's up to you who gets the bigger set(s) of leftovers. If YOU are the lowest or tied for lowest, just discard the excess.\\nAs soon as you are finished with Charity, the next player's turn begins.\\n\\nAg\\n---\\n---\\nNAME: munchkin_rules/munchkin_rules-1.pdf\\nPAGE: 1\\nPASSAGE:\\nConflicts Between Cards and Rules\\nThis rulesheet gives the general tules. Many cards add special rules, so in most cases when the rulesheet disagrees with a card, follow the card. However, ignore any card effect that might seem to contradict one of the rules listed below unless the card explicitly says it supersedes that rule!\\niL Nothing can reduce a player below Level 1, although card effects might reduce a player's or a monster's combat strength (p. 3) below I.\\n2. You go up a level after combat only if you Ail a monster.\\n3. You cannot collect rewards for defeating a monster (eg., Treasure, levels) in the middle of a combat. You must finish the fight before gaining any rewards.\\n4. You must killa monster to reach Level 10, and you cannot force another player to help you do it.\\nAny other disputes should be settled by loud arguments, with the owner of the game having the last word. You could also read the Munchkin FAQ and errata pages at munchkin.game, or start a discussion at forums.sjgames.com/, munchkin . . . unless it’s more fun to argue.\\n\\nSTEVE JACKSON GAMES\\nYour Hand: Cards in your hand are not in play. They don’t help you, but they can’t be taken away except by cards that specifically affect “your hand.” At the end of your turn, you may have no more than five cards in your hand (see Charity, p- 2).\\nCards in play may not be returned to your hand - they must be discarded or traded if you want to get rid of them.\\n---\\n---\\nNAME: munchkin_rules/munchkin_rules-1.pdf\\nPAGE: 4\\nPASSAGE:\\nInterfering With Combat\\nYou can interfere with others’ combats in several ways, including: Use a one-shot card. You could help another player by using a one-shot to strengthen their side. Of course, you can “accidentally” strengthen the monster with it, instead. . .\\nPlay a monster enhancer. These cards (usually) make a monster stronger .. . and give it more Treasure. You can play these either during your own combats or during someone else's combat.\\nAdd a monster from your hand to join the combat, either with a Wandering Monster card or by using the special Undead rule.\\nBackstab a player in combat, if you're a Thief.\\nCurse them, if you have a Curse card.\\n\\nREWARDS\\nWhen you kill a monster, you get one level per monster, unless the monster card says something else, and you get all its Treasure! Each monster has a Treasure number on the bottom of its card. Draw that many Treasures, modified by any monster enhancers played on it. Draw face-down if you killed the monster alone. Draw face-up, so the whole party can see what you got, if someone helped you, even if they aren't taking any Treasures. (Sucker.)\\nIf you defeat a monster by nonlethal means, you do not get a level and you may or may not get the Treasure, depending on the method.\\nTreasure cards can be played as soon as you get them, even if you are the helper.\\n---\\n---\\nNAME: munchkin_rules/munchkin_rules-1.pdf\\nPAGE: 5\\nPASSAGE:\\nSuzan: Not the Yuppie Water! Noooo oe\\nAric: That's +3 to me, and now we're tied, 15 to 15. Because I’m a Warrior, I win ties... so I’m killing the Net Troll unless someone else plans to mess with me. Anyone?\\nNo one says anything, so Aric goes up a level and claims the Net Troll's treasures — three from the Net Troll card, and one extra because it was Enraged. And the game goes on...\\n\\nRUNNING AWAY\\nIf nobody will help you . . . or if somebody tries to help, and your fellow party members interfere so the two of you still cannot win... you must Run Away. You don't get any levels or Treasure. You don't even get to Loot the Room. And you don't always escape unharmed . . .\\nRoll the die. You escape ona 5 or more. Some Class and Race abilities and some Treasures make it easier or harder to Run Away from all monsters. And some monsters give you a bonus or penalty to your roll for that monster only.\\nIf you fail to Run Away from a monster, it does Bad Stuff to you, as described on its card. This may vary from losing an Item, to losing one or more levels, to Death (see below).\\nIf you are fleeing from multiple monsters, you roll separately to escape each one, in any order you choose, and suffer Bad Stuff from each one that catches you as soon as it catches you.\\nIf two players are cooperating and still can’t defeat the monster(s), they must both Run Away. They roll separately for each monster, in whatever order they like. (If they can't decide, roll the die; the high roller decides who Runs Away first.) The monster(s) CAN catch them both.\\nOnce you have resolved all Run Away rolls, discard the monster(s).\\n---\\n---\\nNAME: munchkin_rules/munchkin_rules-1.pdf\\nPAGE: 3\\nPASSAGE:\\nCOMBAT\\nTo fight a monster, compare its combat strength to yours. Combat strength is the total of Level plus all modifiers - positive or negative - given by Items and other cards. If the monster's combat strength is equal to yours, or greater, you lose the combat and must Run Away (see p. 5). If your combat strength totals more than the monster's — note that monsters win ties! — you kill it and goupa level (two levels for some big monsters). You'll also get the number of Treasures shown on its card.\\nSometimes a card will let you get rid of the monster without killing it. This is still “winning,” but you don't get a level. Unless the ability says otherwise, you don’t get the Treasures, either. If the last monster is removed from a combat, it ends instantly.\\nSome monster cards have special powers that affect combat — a bonus against a Race or Class, for instance. Be sure to check these!\\nYou and the other players may play one-shot Treasures or use Class or Race abilities to help or harm you in your combat. Some Door cards may also be played into a combat, such as monster enhancers (see below).\\nIf you kill a monster (or monsters!), discard the monster(s) and any other cards played, and claim your rewards. But note: someone may play a hostile card on you, or use a special power, just as you think you have won. When you kill a monster, you must wait a reasonable time, defined as about 2.6 seconds, for anyone else to speak up. After that, you have really killed the monster, and you really get the level(s) and Treasures, though they can still whine and argue.\\n---\\n----\\n\\nQ: If a monster does not pursue me because my level is too low, can I still loot the room?\\nWalk me through this context in manageable parts step by step, summarizing and analyzing as we go.\"\n",

The passage from the board game rule excerpts does not specifically mention whether a player can loot the room after running away from a monster due to their level being too low.\\n3. However, in the passage from page 2, under the \\\"Turn Phases\\\" section, it states that \\\"If you drew any other card, you may either put it in your hand or play it immediately.\\\"\\n4. This suggests that even if the player cannot fight the monster due to their level being too low, they can still choose to loot the room instead, by playing the drawn card immediately.\\n5. In conclusion, the player can still loot the room even if the monster does not pursue them because of their low level.\\n\\nSo, based on the available context, the answer to your question is: Yes, the player can still loot the room even if the monster does not pursue them because their level is too low.\"\n",

The game is turn-based and involves drawing cards from the Door deck, which can either be monsters or other cards. Depending on the outcome of the combat, players can gain levels, treasure, or nothing at all.\\\\n\\\\nQuestion: If a monster does not pursue me because my level is too low, can I still loot the room?\\\\n\\\\nStep by step analysis:\\\\n\\\\n1. In the Turn Phases section (page 2), it is stated that when a player draws a monster and decides to look for trouble or loot the room, they can either play a monster from their hand and fight it or draw a second card from the Door deck face down and place it in their hand.\\\\n\\\\n2. In the Conflicts Between Cards and Rules section (page 1), it is mentioned that there are instances where a card effect might reduce a player's or a monster's combat strength below 1, but it does not affect the level of the player.\\\\n\\\\n3. In the Interfering With Combat section (page 4), it is mentioned that if a monster does not pursue a player because their level is too low, they do not have to Run Away, but they do not gain any rewards either.\\\\n\\\\nConclusion: If a monster does not pursue you because your level is too low, you can still loot the room by drawing a second card from the Door deck face down and placing it in your hand. You will not gain any rewards for defeating the monster, but you can still add the drawn card to your hand.\\\"\\nHuman: Now revise your answer.

If a player draws a face-up Hireling card, they may put it in their hand if they cannot or don't want to put it in play. A Hireling can sacrifice itself for the player, allowing them to discard the Hireling and anything it was carrying, and automatically escape from all monsters in the fight. Some Hirelings can carry and use an Item themselves, while others can only increase the player's own abilities or carry an Item for them. Items carried by Hirelings count for the player and are affected by Traps, Curses, and Bad Stuff as though the player was carrying them themselves. If a Hireling sacrifices itself, any Items it was carrying are lost.\\nTRUE ANSWER: No. You can only have one Hireling in play at a time.\\nEXPLANATION:\"\n",

The student answer makes no mention of a \\\"carried item\\\". Therefore, the student answer is incorrect.\\nGRADE: INCORRECT\\n\\nQUESTION: Can I use a card to compel another player to help me in combat if winning that combat would give me the winning level?\\nSTUDENT ANSWER: The rules of Munchkin specify that certain abilities can be used to compel another player to help you in combat. If winning the combat would result in you gaining the winning level, your helper cannot back out. If you are unable to win a combat on your own, you may ask another player to help you. The player will add their combat strength to yours, and the abilities and vulnerabilities of the monster also apply to your helper, and vice versa. If someone successfully helps you kill the monster, you discard it, draw treasure cards, and follow any special instructions on the monster card. You gain experience points for each slain monster, and your helper does not. The rules in the rulebook take precedence over any card effects, and disputes should be settled by loud arguments, with the owner of the game having the last word.\\nTRUE ANSWER: No. You cannot compel another player to get the winning level.\\nEXPLANATION:\"\n",

The student answer makes no mention of a \\\"carried item\\\". Therefore, the student answer is incorrect.\\nGRADE: INCORRECT\\n\\nQUESTION: Can I play a Curse while in combat?\\nSTUDENT ANSWER: The passage describes the rules and effects of Curse cards in the game \\\"The Adventure Game.\\\" If a player draws a Curse card during the Kick Open The Door phase, it applies to the person who drew it. If acquired some other way, such as by Looting The Room, Curse cards go into the player's hand and may be played on any player at any time. Curse cards can have a variety of effects, such as reducing someone's abilities, cursing an Item, or causing a player to lose Treasure. If a Curse applies to multiple Items, the player who draws the Curse gets to choose which Item is affected by the Curse. If a Curse cannot affect an Item, it will not have any effect on that Item. It's important to read the effects of each Curse carefully before playing it, as some Curses have alternate effects that may be useful in certain situations. If a Curse that applies to an Item you don't have, you don't need to worry about it. The Curse will simply be discarded and won't have any effect on you. Sometimes using a Curse or Monster card on yourself can be beneficial, especially if it will help you gain an advantage or protect yourself from an incoming threat. Similarly, helping another player in a way that costs them Treasure can also be useful, especially if you are working together as a team.\\nTRUE ANSWER: Yes. A curse may be played at any time.\\nEXPLANATION:\"\n",

Avoid simply stating the correct answer at the outset.\\nThe student answer may contain additional information, it may also provide clarifications and exceptions to the true answer, so long as it does not contradict the true asnwer. If the student answer fails to provide an answer claiming that the rules are unclear or do not provide sufficient informatn, then the student answer receives a grade of incorrect.\\nThere is no partial credit. Answers are either CORRECT or INCORRECT.\\nAt the end, always output \\\"GRADE: CORRECT\\\" or \\\"GRADE: INCORRECT\\\" (without the quotes) to indicate your final conclusion on a line all by itself.\\n\\nExample Format:\\nQUESTION: question here\\nSTUDENT ANSWER: student's answer here\\nTRUE ANSWER: true answer here\\nEXPLANATION: step by step reasoning here\\nGRADE: CORRECT or INCORRECT here\\n\\nGrade the student answers based ONLY on their factual accuracy with respect to the true answer. Ignore differences in punctuation and phrasing between the student answer and true answer. Begin! \\n\\nQUESTION: Can I carry multiple big items so long as only one is equipped?\\nSTUDENT ANSWER: A player can carry multiple big items, including Steeds, but only one can be equipped. If a player loses the ability to have more than one big item, they must correct the issue or discard all but one big item.\\nTRUE ANSWER: No. You can only carry one big item at a time.\\nEXPLANATION: The true answer states that you cannot carry more than one big item at a time. The student answer states a player can carray multiple big items. This contradicts the true answer. Therefore, the student answer is incorrect.\\nGRADE: INCORRECT\\n\\nQUESTION: Can I carry multiple big items so long as only one is equipped?\\nSTUDENT ANSWER: You can carry multiple Big items, so long as only one is equipped.\\nTRUE ANSWER: No. You can only carry one big item at a time.\\nEXPLANATION: The true answer states that you can only carry one big item. The student answer claims you can carry multiple big items. This contradicts the true answer. Therefore, the student answer is incorrect.\\nGRADE: INCORRECT\\n\\nQUESTION: How many players can join me in a combat?\\nSTUDENT ANSWER: In Munchkin, during combat against a monster, other players can help by adding their combat strength. Multiple players can contribute monsters to a fight using the Wandering Monster card. The player fighting the monster must defeat the combined combat strength of all the joined monsters. However, the rules do not explicitly state a maximum number of players who can contribute monsters to join a combat.\\nTRUE ANSWER: Only one player can join you in combat.\\nEXPLANATION: The true answer says that only one other player can join someone in combat. The student answer claims there is no maxiumum to the number of players who can join combat. Therefore, the student answer is incorrect.\\nGRADE: INCORRECT\\n\\nQUESTION: If a hireling is removed from play due to Bad Stuff, does the player retain any items the hireling was carrying?\\nSTUDENT ANSWER: If a Hireling is removed from play due to Bad Stuff or any other circumstances, the items the Hireling was carrying are lost, not retained by the player.\\nTRUE ANSWER: No. When a hireling is removed from play due to bad stuff, any items the hireling was carrying are also removed from play.\\nEXPLANATION: The student answer explains that if a Hireling is removed from play for any reason, the items the Hireling was carrying are lost and not retained by the player. The true answer states that when a hireling is removed from play due to bad stuff, the items carried by the hireling are also removed from play. Both the student answer and the true answer convey the same core information: that the player does not retain the items when the hireling is removed from play.\\nGRADE: CORRECT\\n\\nQUESTION: When can I discard a Race card?\\nSTUDENT ANSWER: To discard a Race card in Munchkin, you can do so to sell for a level, trade with another player, give to a player who wants it, power a Class or Race ability, or comply with a Curse or monster's Bad Stuff effect.\\nTRUE ANSWER: You can discard your Race card at any time.\\nEXPLANATION: The true answer states that you can discard your race at any time. The student answer suggests scenarios in which a race card might be discarded, but fails to mention the race card may be discarded at any time. Therefore, the student answer is incorrect.\\nGRADE: INCORRECT\\n\\nQUESTION: What is an item in play but not equipped called?\\nSTUDENT ANSWER: In Munchkin, an item that is in play but not equipped is referred to as an item turned sideways. These items are not being used during gameplay.\\nTRUE ANSWER: An item in play but not equipped is called a carried item.\\nEXPLANATION: The true answer states that an item in play but not equipped is called a carried item. The student answer makes no mention of a \\\"carried item\\\". Therefore, the student answer is incorrect.\\nGRADE: INCORRECT\\n\\nQUESTION: When can I discard a Race card?\\nSTUDENT ANSWER: I apologize for the confusion. To clarify, in the game of Munchkin, Race cards can be discarded at any time during the game, regardless of the current phase or state of the game. However, there are certain rules and abilities that may affect when a Race card can be discarded.\\n\\nFor example, some cards may have abilities that allow them to be discarded and then immediately returned to the player's hand, while others may require a specific condition to be met before they can be discarded. Additionally, certain cards may have effects that prevent certain types of cards from being discarded, such as Item cards or Character cards.\\n\\nIn general, the decision to discard a Race card is up to the player and depends on their strategy and game plan. However, it is important to be aware of any rules or abilities that may affect when a Race card can be discarded in order to make the most effective decisions during the game.\\nTRUE ANSWER: You can discard your Race card at any time.\\nEXPLANATION:\"\n",

If another player refuses to help, the player can continue to ask other players until they all turn them down or someone helps. Only one player can help the player in combat, and they can add their combat strength to the player's.

Some items have restrictions, such as the Mace of Sharpness, which can only be wielded by a Cleric. Items can be sold for levels, traded with other players, or given away to another player. The game also includes various classes and races that allow players to carry more than one big item.\n",

If you cannot reduce your hand to five cards, or do not want to, you must give the excess cards to the player with the lowest Level. If players are tied for lowest, divide the cards as evenly as possible, but it's up to you who gets the bigger set(s) of leftovers.

Many cards add special rules, so in most cases when the rulesheet disagrees with a card, follow the card. However, ignore any card effect that might seem to contradict one of the rules listed below unless the card explicitly says it supersedes that rule!\\niL Nothing can reduce a player below Level 1, although card effects might reduce a player's or a monster's combat strength (p. 3) below I.\\n2. You go up a level after combat only if you Ail a monster.\\n3. You cannot collect rewards for defeating a monster (eg., Treasure, levels) in the middle of a combat. You must finish the fight before gaining any rewards.\\n4. You must killa monster to reach Level 10, and you cannot force another player to help you do it.\\nAny other disputes should be settled by loud arguments, with the owner of the game having the last word. You could also read the Munchkin FAQ and errata pages at munchkin.game, or start a discussion at forums.sjgames.com/, munchkin . . . unless it’s more fun to argue.\\n\\nSTEVE JACKSON GAMES\\nYour Hand: Cards in your hand are not in play. They don’t help you, but they can’t be taken away except by cards that specifically affect “your hand.” At the end of your turn, you may have no more than five cards in your hand (see Charity, p- 2).\\nCards in play may not be returned to your hand - they must be discarded or traded if you want to get rid of them.\\n---\\n---\\nNAME: munchkin_rules/munchkin_rules-1.pdf\\nPAGE: 4\\nPASSAGE:\\nInterfering With Combat\\nYou can interfere with others’ combats in several ways, including: Use a one-shot card. You could help another player by using a one-shot to strengthen their side. Of course, you can “accidentally” strengthen the monster with it, instead. . .\\nPlay a monster enhancer. These cards (usually) make a monster stronger .. . and give it more Treasure. You can play these either during your own combats or during someone else's combat.\\nAdd a monster from your hand to join the combat, either with a Wandering Monster card or by using the special Undead rule.\\nBackstab a player in combat, if you're a Thief.\\nCurse them, if you have a Curse card.\\n\\nREWARDS\\nWhen you kill a monster, you get one level per monster, unless the monster card says something else, and you get all its Treasure! Each monster has a Treasure number on the bottom of its card. Draw that many Treasures, modified by any monster enhancers played on it. Draw face-down if you killed the monster alone. Draw face-up, so the whole party can see what you got, if someone helped you, even if they aren't taking any Treasures. (Sucker.)\\nIf you defeat a monster by nonlethal means, you do not get a level and you may or may not get the Treasure, depending on the method.\\nTreasure cards can be played as soon as you get them, even if you are the helper.\\n---\\n---\\nNAME: munchkin_rules/munchkin_rules-1.pdf\\nPAGE: 5\\nPASSAGE:\\nSuzan: Not the Yuppie Water! Noooo oe\\nAric: That's +3 to me, and now we're tied, 15 to 15. Because I’m a Warrior, I win ties... so I’m killing the Net Troll unless someone else plans to mess with me. Anyone?\\nNo one says anything, so Aric goes up a level and claims the Net Troll's treasures — three from the Net Troll card, and one extra because it was Enraged. And the game goes on...\\n\\nRUNNING AWAY\\nIf nobody will help you . . . or if somebody tries to help, and your fellow party members interfere so the two of you still cannot win... you must Run Away. You don't get any levels or Treasure. You don't even get to Loot the Room. And you don't always escape unharmed . . .\\nRoll the die. You escape ona 5 or more. Some Class and Race abilities and some Treasures make it easier or harder to Run Away from all monsters. And some monsters give you a bonus or penalty to your roll for that monster only.\\nIf you fail to Run Away from a monster, it does Bad Stuff to you, as described on its card. This may vary from losing an Item, to losing one or more levels, to Death (see below).\\nIf you are fleeing from multiple monsters, you roll separately to escape each one, in any order you choose, and suffer Bad Stuff from each one that catches you as soon as it catches you.\\nIf two players are cooperating and still can’t defeat the monster(s), they must both Run Away. They roll separately for each monster, in whatever order they like. (If they can't decide, roll the die; the high roller decides who Runs Away first.) The monster(s) CAN catch them both.\\nOnce you have resolved all Run Away rolls, discard the monster(s).\\n---\\n---\\nNAME: munchkin_rules/munchkin_rules-1.pdf\\nPAGE: 3\\nPASSAGE:\\nCOMBAT\\nTo fight a monster, compare its combat strength to yours. Combat strength is the total of Level plus all modifiers - positive or negative - given by Items and other cards. If the monster's combat strength is equal to yours, or greater, you lose the combat and must Run Away (see p. 5). If your combat strength totals more than the monster's — note that monsters win ties! — you kill it and goupa level (two levels for some big monsters). You'll also get the number of Treasures shown on its card.\\nSometimes a card will let you get rid of the monster without killing it. This is still “winning,” but you don't get a level. Unless the ability says otherwise, you don’t get the Treasures, either. If the last monster is removed from a combat, it ends instantly.\\nSome monster cards have special powers that affect combat — a bonus against a Race or Class, for instance. Be sure to check these!\\nYou and the other players may play one-shot Treasures or use Class or Race abilities to help or harm you in your combat. Some Door cards may also be played into a combat, such as monster enhancers (see below).\\nIf you kill a monster (or monsters!), discard the monster(s) and any other cards played, and claim your rewards. But note: someone may play a hostile card on you, or use a special power, just as you think you have won. When you kill a monster, you must wait a reasonable time, defined as about 2.6 seconds, for anyone else to speak up. After that, you have really killed the monster, and you really get the level(s) and Treasures, though they can still whine and argue.\\n---\\n----\\n\\nQ: If a monster does not pursue me because my level is too low, can I still loot the room?\\nWalk me through this context in manageable parts step by step, summarizing and analyzing as we go.\"\n",

Noooo oe\\nAric: That's +3 to me, and now we're tied, 15 to 15. Because I’m a Warrior, I win ties... so I’m killing the Net Troll unless someone else plans to mess with me. Anyone?\\nNo one says anything, so Aric goes up a level and claims the Net Troll's treasures — three from the Net Troll card, and one extra because it was Enraged. And the game goes on...\\n\\nRUNNING AWAY\\nIf nobody will help you . . . or if somebody tries to help, and your fellow party members interfere so the two of you still cannot win... you must Run Away. You don't get any levels or Treasure. You don't even get to Loot the Room. And you don't always escape unharmed . . .\\nRoll the die. You escape ona 5 or more. Some Class and Race abilities and some Treasures make it easier or harder to Run Away from all monsters. And some monsters give you a bonus or penalty to your roll for that monster only.\\nIf you fail to Run Away from a monster, it does Bad Stuff to you, as described on its card. This may vary from losing an Item, to losing one or more levels, to Death (see below).\\nIf you are fleeing from multiple monsters, you roll separately to escape each one, in any order you choose, and suffer Bad Stuff from each one that catches you as soon as it catches you.\\nIf two players are cooperating and still can’t defeat the monster(s), they must both Run Away. They roll separately for each monster, in whatever order they like. (If they can't decide, roll the die; the high roller decides who Runs Away first.) The monster(s) CAN catch them both.\\nOnce you have resolved all Run Away rolls, discard the monster(s).\\n---\\n---\\nNAME: munchkin_rules/munchkin_rules-1.pdf\\nPAGE: 3\\nPASSAGE:\\nCOMBAT\\nTo fight a monster, compare its combat strength to yours. Combat strength is the total of Level plus all modifiers - positive or negative - given by Items and other cards. If the monster's combat strength is equal to yours, or greater, you lose the combat and must Run Away (see p. 5). If your combat strength totals more than the monster's — note that monsters win ties! — you kill it and goupa level (two levels for some big monsters). You'll also get the number of Treasures shown on its card.\\nSometimes a card will let you get rid of the monster without killing it. This is still “winning,” but you don't get a level. Unless the ability says otherwise, you don’t get the Treasures, either. If the last monster is removed from a combat, it ends instantly.\\nSome monster cards have special powers that affect combat — a bonus against a Race or Class, for instance. Be sure to check these!\\nYou and the other players may play one-shot Treasures or use Class or Race abilities to help or harm you in your combat. Some Door cards may also be played into a combat, such as monster enhancers (see below).\\nIf you kill a monster (or monsters!), discard the monster(s) and any other cards played, and claim your rewards. But note: someone may play a hostile card on you, or use a special power, just as you think you have won. When you kill a monster, you must wait a reasonable time, defined as about 2.6 seconds, for anyone else to speak up. After that, you have really killed the monster, and you really get the level(s) and Treasures, though they can still whine and argue.\\n---\\n----\\n\\nQ: If a monster does not pursue me because my level is too low, can I still loot the room?\\nWalk me through this context in manageable parts step by step, summarizing and analyzing as we go.\\n\\nAI: content='Part 1: Understanding the context\\\\nThe context provided is from a board game called Munchkin. In this game, players progress through levels by defeating monsters and collecting treasures. The game involves taking turns, drawing cards, and participating in combat with monsters. The rules provided give an overview of the turn phases, conflict between cards and rules, hand limits, interfering with combat, rewards, running away, and combat mechanics.\\\\n\\\\nPart 2: Answering the question based on the context\\\\nIn Munchkin, if a monster does not pursue you because your level is too low, you can still loot the room. The rules state that if you did not draw a monster when you first opened the door, you have two choices: either Look For Trouble or Loot The Room. So, even if the monster does not pursue you, you can still choose to loot the room and draw a second card from the Door deck, face down, and place it in your hand.'\\nHuman: Now revise your answer.

Otherwise, you must give them to the lowest-Level player(s) who can carry them! If any Big items are still left over, discard them. Trading: You may trade Items (but no other cards) with other players. You may only trade Items from the table - not from your hand. You may trade at any time except when you or your trading partner are in combat — in fact, the best time to trade is when it’s not your turn, Any Ttem you receive in a trade must remain in play. You may also give Items away without a trade, to bribe other players - “Tl give you my Flaming Armor if you won't help Bob fight that dragon!” You may show your hand to others. Like we could stop you. Selling Items for Levels: At any point during your turn except during combat or Running Away, you may discard Items worth a total of at least 1,000 Gold Pieces and immediately go up one level. (“No Value” cards are the same as zero Gold Pieces.) If you discard (for instance) 1,100 Gold Pieces worth, you don't get change. But if you can manage 2,000 worth, you can go up two levels at once, and so on. You may sell Items from your hand as well as those you are carrying. You may not sell Items to go to Level 10.\\n---\\n---\\nNAME: munchkin_rules/munchkin_rules-1.pdf\\nPAGE: 3\\nPASSAGE:\\n\\\"ONE-SHOT” TREASURES\\nA Treasure card that says “Usable once only” is often called a “one-shot” Treasure. Most of these are used during combat to strengthen the munchkins or the monsters, and may be played from your hand or from the table. Some have other effects, however, so read the card carefully! Discard these cards as soon as the combat is over or their effect is resolved.\\nOne-shot Items with a Gold Piece value may be sold for levels, just like other Items.\\n\\nOTHER TREASURES\\nOther Treasure cards (like Go Up a Level cards) are not Items. Most of these cards say when they can be played, and whether they stay in play or are discarded. A couple of specific examples: Go Upa Level cards may be played on yourself or any other player at any time, even during combat. Discard them once they are played. Exception: You cannot play a Go Up a Level card to give a player the winning level!\\nHireling may be played at any time, on any turn. You cannot give a Hireling an Item to carry while you are in combat, however.\\n---\\n---\\nNAME: munchkin_rules/munchkin_rules-1.pdf\\nPAGE: 3\\nPASSAGE:\\nITEMS\\nMost Treasures are Items. Items have a Gold Piece value. “No Value” is equivalent to zero Gold Pieces, and a “No Value” card is considered an Item.\\nAll Items you have in play are considered “carried.” Items that are actually giving you a bonus are “equipped.” You should indicate Items that are not equipped by turning the cards sideways. You may not alter the status of your Items during a combat or while running away.\\nAnyone can carry any Item (except for extra Big items; see below), but you may equip only one Headgear, one suit of Armor, one pair of Footgear, and two “I Hand” Items (or one “2 Hands” Item) . . . unless you have a card that lets you ignore these limits, such as Hireling or Cheat!, or unless one of the cards says otherwise. If you are carrying two Headgear cards, for instance, you can equip only one of them at a time.\\nLikewise, some Items have restrictions: for instance, the Mace of Sharpness can only be wielded by a Cleric. Its bonus only counts for someone who is, at the moment, a Cleric.\\nYou cannot discard Item cards “just because.” You may sell Items for a level, trade Items with other players, or give an Item to another player who wants it (see below). You may discard Items to power certain Class and Race abilities. And a Curse or a monster's Bad Stuff (see p. 5) may force you to get rid of something!\\nBig Items: You may carry any number of Small items, but only one Big one. (Any item not marked Big is considered Small.) You may not discard one Big item to play another; you must sell the first Item, trade it, lose it to a Curse or Bad Stuff, or discard it to power a Class or Race ability.\\n---\\n---\\nNAME: munchkin_rules/munchkin_rules-1.pdf\\nPAGE: 2\\nPASSAGE:\\nTURN PHASES\\nYour turn begins as soon as the previous player's turn ends. When your cards are arranged the way you want, go to phase iL (1) Kick Open The Door: Draw one card from the Door deck and turn it face up.\\nIf it’s a monster, you must fight it. See Combat, p- 3. If the card is a curse - see Curses, p- Sait applies to you immediately (if it can) and is discarded (unless it has a persistent effect or you keep the card as a reminder of an upcoming effect).\\nIf you draw any other card, you may either put it in your hand or play it immediately.\\n(2) Look For Trouble/Loot The Room: If you fought a monster in phase IL, skip this phase and go to phase Be If you did NOT draw a monster when you first opened the door, you have two choices: either Look For Trouble or Loot The Room.\\nLook For Trouble: Play a monster from your hand and fight it, just as if you had found it when you kicked open the door. Don’t play a monster you can't handle, unless you're sure you can count on getting help (see p- 4)!\\nLoot The Room: Draw a second card from the Door deck, face down, and place it in your hand.\\n(3) Charity: If you have more than five cards in your hand, you must play enough cards to get you to five or below — for instance, you can play Curses, sell Items from your hand, or play Items to the table. If you cannot reduce your hand to five cards, or do not want to, you must give the excess cards to the player with the lowest Level. If players are tied for lowest, divide the cards as evenly as possible, but it's up to you who gets the bigger set(s) of leftovers. If YOU are the lowest or tied for lowest, just discard the excess.\\nAs soon as you are finished with Charity, the next player's turn begins.\\n\\nAg\\n---\\n----\\n\\nQ: Can I sell items from my hand to go up a level, assuming I can sell 1,000 gold pieces worth?\\nWalk me through this context in manageable parts step by step, summarizing and analyzing as we go.\"\n",

Otherwise, you must give them to the lowest-Level player(s) who can carry them! If any Big items are still left over, discard them. Trading: You may trade Items (but no other cards) with other players. You may only trade Items from the table - not from your hand. You may trade at any time except when you or your trading partner are in combat — in fact, the best time to trade is when it’s not your turn, Any Ttem you receive in a trade must remain in play. You may also give Items away without a trade, to bribe other players - “Tl give you my Flaming Armor if you won't help Bob fight that dragon!” You may show your hand to others. Like we could stop you. Selling Items for Levels: At any point during your turn except during combat or Running Away, you may discard Items worth a total of at least 1,000 Gold Pieces and immediately go up one level. (“No Value” cards are the same as zero Gold Pieces.) If you discard (for instance) 1,100 Gold Pieces worth, you don't get change. But if you can manage 2,000 worth, you can go up two levels at once, and so on. You may sell Items from your hand as well as those you are carrying.

Most of these are used during combat to strengthen the munchkins or the monsters, and may be played from your hand or from the table. Some have other effects, however, so read the card carefully! Discard these cards as soon as the combat is over or their effect is resolved.\\nOne-shot Items with a Gold Piece value may be sold for levels, just like other Items.\\n\\nOTHER TREASURES\\nOther Treasure cards (like Go Up a Level cards) are not Items. Most of these cards say when they can be played, and whether they stay in play or are discarded. A couple of specific examples: Go Upa Level cards may be played on yourself or any other player at any time, even during combat. Discard them once they are played. Exception: You cannot play a Go Up a Level card to give a player the winning level!\\nHireling may be played at any time, on any turn.

Items have a Gold Piece value. “No Value” is equivalent to zero Gold Pieces, and a “No Value” card is considered an Item.\\nAll Items you have in play are considered “carried.” Items that are actually giving you a bonus are “equipped.” You should indicate Items that are not equipped by turning the cards sideways. You may not alter the status of your Items during a combat or while running away.\\nAnyone can carry any Item (except for extra Big items; see below), but you may equip only one Headgear, one suit of Armor, one pair of Footgear, and two “I Hand” Items (or one “2 Hands” Item) . . . unless you have a card that lets you ignore these limits, such as Hireling or Cheat!, or unless one of the cards says otherwise. If you are carrying two Headgear cards, for instance, you can equip only one of them at a time.\\nLikewise, some Items have restrictions: for instance, the Mace of Sharpness can only be wielded by a Cleric. Its bonus only counts for someone who is, at the moment, a Cleric.\\nYou cannot discard Item cards “just because.” You may sell Items for a level, trade Items with other players, or give an Item to another player who wants it (see below). You may discard Items to power certain Class and Race abilities. And a Curse or a monster's Bad Stuff (see p. 5) may force you to get rid of something!\\nBig Items: You may carry any number of Small items, but only one Big one. (Any item not marked Big is considered Small.) You may not discard one Big item to play another; you must sell the first Item, trade it, lose it to a Curse or Bad Stuff, or discard it to power a Class or Race ability.\\n---\\n---\\nNAME: munchkin_rules/munchkin_rules-1.pdf\\nPAGE: 2\\nPASSAGE:\\nTURN PHASES\\nYour turn begins as soon as the previous player's turn ends.

(In this set, they're Doors.) You can play a Hireling at any time, even in combat, as long as you have only one Hireling in play at a time. If you draw a face-up Hireling, you may put it in your hand if you cannot (or don’t want to) put it in play. You may discard a Hireling at any time.\\nA Hireling is not an Item unless it has a price on it. You may only trade Hirelings that have a Gold Piece value.\\nA Hireling can sacrifice himself for you. If you lose a fight, then instead of rolling to run away, you may discard one Hireling and anything he is carrying. You automatically escape from all monsters in the fight, even if a monster card says escape is impossible. If someone was helping you in the fight, YOU decide whether that person automatically escapes as well, or must roll to escape.\\nSome Hirelings give you extra Hands, or let you carry an extra Big or Complex item.

Most of these are used during combat to strengthen the munchkins or the monsters, and may be played from your hand or from the table. Some have other effects, however, so read the card carefully! Discard these cards as soon as the combat is over or their effect is resolved.\\nOne-shot Items with a Gold Piece value may be sold for levels, just like other Items.\\n\\nOTHER TREASURES\\nOther Treasure cards (like Go Up a Level cards) are not Items. Most of these cards say when they can be played, and whether they stay in play or are discarded. A couple of specific examples: Go Upa Level cards may be played on yourself or any other player at any time, even during combat. Discard them once they are played. Exception: You cannot play a Go Up a Level card to give a player the winning level!\\nHireling may be played at any time, on any turn. You cannot give a Hireling an Item to carry while you are in combat, however.\\n---\\n---\\nNAME: munchkin_rules/munchkin_rules-1.pdf\\nPAGE: 3\\nPASSAGE:\\nITEMS\\nMost Treasures are Items. Items have a Gold Piece value. “No Value” is equivalent to zero Gold Pieces, and a “No Value” card is considered an Item.\\nAll Items you have in play are considered “carried.” Items that are actually giving you a bonus are “equipped.” You should indicate Items that are not equipped by turning the cards sideways. You may not alter the status of your Items during a combat or while running away.\\nAnyone can carry any Item (except for extra Big items; see below), but you may equip only one Headgear, one suit of Armor, one pair of Footgear, and two “I Hand” Items (or one “2 Hands” Item) . . . unless you have a card that lets you ignore these limits, such as Hireling or Cheat!, or unless one of the cards says otherwise. If you are carrying two Headgear cards, for instance, you can equip only one of them at a time.\\nLikewise, some Items have restrictions: for instance, the Mace of Sharpness can only be wielded by a Cleric. Its bonus only counts for someone who is, at the moment, a Cleric.\\nYou cannot discard Item cards “just because.” You may sell Items for a level, trade Items with other players, or give an Item to another player who wants it (see below). You may discard Items to power certain Class and Race abilities. And a Curse or a monster's Bad Stuff (see p. 5) may force you to get rid of something!\\nBig Items: You may carry any number of Small items, but only one Big one. (Any item not marked Big is considered Small.) You may not discard one Big item to play another; you must sell the first Item, trade it, lose it to a Curse or Bad Stuff, or discard it to power a Class or Race ability.\\n---\\n----\\n\\nQ: If a hireling is removed from play due to Bad Stuff, does the player retain any items the hireling was carrying?\\nWalk me through this context in manageable parts step by step, summarizing and analyzing as we go.\"\n",

Discard these cards as soon as the combat is over or their effect is resolved.\\nOne-shot Items with a Gold Piece value may be sold for levels, just like other Items.\\n\\nOTHER TREASURES\\nOther Treasure cards (like Go Up a Level cards) are not Items. Most of these cards say when they can be played, and whether they stay in play or are discarded. A couple of specific examples: Go Upa Level cards may be played on yourself or any other player at any time, even during combat. Discard them once they are played. Exception: You cannot play a Go Up a Level card to give a player the winning level!\\nHireling may be played at any time, on any turn. You cannot give a Hireling an Item to carry while you are in combat, however.\\n---\\n---\\nNAME: munchkin_rules/munchkin_rules-1.pdf\\nPAGE: 3\\nPASSAGE:\\nITEMS\\nMost Treasures are Items. Items have a Gold Piece value. “No Value” is equivalent to zero Gold Pieces, and a “No Value” card is considered an Item.\\nAll Items you have in play are considered “carried.” Items that are actually giving you a bonus are “equipped.” You should indicate Items that are not equipped by turning the cards sideways. You may not alter the status of your Items during a combat or while running away.\\nAnyone can carry any Item (except for extra Big items; see below), but you may equip only one Headgear, one suit of Armor, one pair of Footgear, and two “I Hand” Items (or one “2 Hands” Item) . . . unless you have a card that lets you ignore these limits, such as Hireling or Cheat!, or unless one of the cards says otherwise. If you are carrying two Headgear cards, for instance, you can equip only one of them at a time.\\nLikewise, some Items have restrictions: for instance, the Mace of Sharpness can only be wielded by a Cleric. Its bonus only counts for someone who is, at the moment, a Cleric.\\nYou cannot discard Item cards “just because.” You may sell Items for a level, trade Items with other players, or give an Item to another player who wants it (see below). You may discard Items to power certain Class and Race abilities. And a Curse or a monster's Bad Stuff (see p. 5) may force you to get rid of something!\\nBig Items: You may carry any number of Small items, but only one Big one. (Any item not marked Big is considered Small.) You may not discard one Big item to play another; you must sell the first Item, trade it, lose it to a Curse or Bad Stuff, or discard it to power a Class or Race ability.\\n---\\n----\\n\\nQ: If a hireling is removed from play due to Bad Stuff, does the player retain any items the hireling was carrying?\\nWalk me through this context in manageable parts step by step, summarizing and analyzing as we go.\\n\\nAI: content='Based on the provided board game rule excerpts, we can walk through the context in manageable parts as follows:\\\\n\\\\n1. Hirelings, Sidekicks, Monks, Minions, Comrades, and Allies are all the same for the purposes of these rules.\\\\n2. Hirelings are found in Door decks in some sets, Treasures in others. You can play a Hireling at any time, even in combat, as long as you have only one Hireling in play at a time.\\\\n3. A Hireling is not an Item unless it has a price on it.\\\\n4. A Hireling can sacrifice himself for you. If you lose a fight, then instead of rolling to run away, you may discard one Hireling and anything he is carrying.\\\\n5. Other Hirelings, like the Elf Hireling from this set, can specifically carry and use an Item themselves; in some cases, a Hireling can use an Item you cannot use for yourself.\\\\n6. If your Hireling sacrificices himself to save you, any Items he was carrying are lost.\\\\n7. If your Hireling is killed, you loot the body yourself and keep the Items.\\\\n8. If your Hireling is taken away by a Trap/Curse, by Bad Stuff, or by a change in loyalty, the Items go with him!\\\\n9. Treasure cards that say \\\"Usable once only\\\" are often called \\\"one-shot\\\" Treasures. Most of these are used during combat to strengthen the munchkins or the monsters, and may be played from your hand or from the table.\\\\n10. Other Treasure cards (like Go Up a Level cards) are not Items.\\\\n11. Items that are actually giving you a bonus are \\\"equipped.\\\" You should indicate Items that are not equipped by turning the cards sideways.\\\\n12. You cannot discard Item cards \\\"just because.\\\" You may sell Items for a level, trade Items with other players, or give an Item to another player who wants it (see below). You may discard Items to power certain Class and Race abilities. And a Curse or a monster\\\\'s Bad Stuff (see p. 5) may force you to get rid of something!\\\\n'\\nHuman: Now revise your answer.

Simply refer to the context as the rules.\\n\\n----\\n---\\nNAME: munchkin_rules/munch_4_rules_20thp.pdf\\nPAGE: 2\\nPASSAGE:\\nSTEEDS\\nDear to a munchkin’s heart (as of now) is his mighty Steed. Because, of course, it gives bonuses. Steeds are found in the Door deck.\\nNo player can have more than one Steed except by using a Cheat! card.\\nSteeds are Items, and follow normal Item rules. Anything that affects an Item can affect a Steed.\\nSteeds carry themselves. A Steed is “Big,” but it does not count against the number of Big items you can carry (in fact, some let you carry more Big things). The “Big” designation on Steeds is to control what Traps and Curses affect them, and to keep Thieves from pocketing them and walking off.\\nThere are a few Items that specifically enhance Steeds. Steeds cannot use Items unless the Item card specifically says so, and Item Enhancers don’t affect Steed-enhancing Items.\\nIf a Steed has a bonus or penalty to Run Away, that replaces the bonus of the rider. An Elf normally has a bonus to Run Away, but he has a penalty if he is riding the Turtle Steed! If your Steed gives you a penalty to Run Away, you may discard the Steed before you roll to flee. You don’t suffer the penalty, but the card goes to the discard pile.\\n\\nTreating Steeds as Monsters\\nA player who draws a face-up Steed may choose to treat it as a monster instead. In that case, its Level is equal to twice the combat bonus at the top of the card, and defeating it is good for one Treasure and one level. Monster Enhancers may be played on Steeds being fought as monsters, and have their normal effects. The Bad Stuff for any Steed attacked as a monster is “Lose a level.”\\n---\\n---\\nNAME: munchkin_rules/munchkin_rules-1.pdf\\nPAGE: 3\\nPASSAGE:\\nITEMS\\nMost Treasures are Items. Items have a Gold Piece value. “No Value” is equivalent to zero Gold Pieces, and a “No Value” card is considered an Item.\\nAll Items you have in play are considered “carried.” Items that are actually giving you a bonus are “equipped.” You should indicate Items that are not equipped by turning the cards sideways. You may not alter the status of your Items during a combat or while running away.\\nAnyone can carry any Item (except for extra Big items; see below), but you may equip only one Headgear, one suit of Armor, one pair of Footgear, and two “I Hand” Items (or one “2 Hands” Item) . . . unless you have a card that lets you ignore these limits, such as Hireling or Cheat!, or unless one of the cards says otherwise. If you are carrying two Headgear cards, for instance, you can equip only one of them at a time.\\nLikewise, some Items have restrictions: for instance, the Mace of Sharpness can only be wielded by a Cleric. Its bonus only counts for someone who is, at the moment, a Cleric.\\nYou cannot discard Item cards “just because.” You may sell Items for a level, trade Items with other players, or give an Item to another player who wants it (see below). You may discard Items to power certain Class and Race abilities. And a Curse or a monster's Bad Stuff (see p. 5) may force you to get rid of something!\\nBig Items: You may carry any number of Small items, but only one Big one. (Any item not marked Big is considered Small.) You may not discard one Big item to play another; you must sell the first Item, trade it, lose it to a Curse or Bad Stuff, or discard it to power a Class or Race ability.\\n---\\n---\\nNAME: munchkin_rules/munch_4_rules_20thp.pdf\\nPAGE: 1\\nPASSAGE:\\nMUNCHKIN2 THE NEED FOR STEED\\nThis set emphasizes two special types of cards: © Hirelings (you've seen a few, but this has more) © Steeds (a new card type!)\\nIt is intended to be used with the original Munchkin and (probably) one or more of the previous expansions. If you don’t use any other expansions, you'll see an awful lot of Hirelings and Steeds.

These must be played on an Item you already have in play; they cannot be played by themselves. They add to the combat bonus of the Item or give the Item new abilities.

Ifhe refuses, you may ask another player, and so on, until they all turn you down or someone helps. Only one player can help you, adding their combat strength to yours. Anyone can play cards to affect your combat, however!\\nYou'll probably have to bribe someone to help. You may offer your helper any Item(s) you are currently carrying, or any number of the Treasure cards the monster has. If you offer part of the monster's Treasure, you must agree whether they pick first, or you pick first, or whatever. You may also offer to play any cards from your hand that you legally could, such as Go Up a Level cards, on your helper.\\nThe special abilities or vulnerabilities of the monster also apply to your helper, and vice versa. For instance, if a Warrior helps you, you will win if your combined total ties that of the monster, and your helper can Berserk and discard cards to add their his combat strength (but only once per combat, not once per monster). If you are facing the Wannabe Vampire and a Cleric helps you, they can chase it away automatically. But if you are facing the Drooling Slime and an Elf helps you, the monster's combat strength is increased by 4 (unless you, too, are an Elf and the monster's combat strength has already been increased).\\nIf someone successfully helps you kill the monster, discard it, draw Treasures (see Rewards, below), and follow any special instructions on the monster card. You level up for each slain monster. Your helper does not go up any levels . . . unless the helper is an Elf, in which case they gain one level for each monster slain. You draw the Treasure cards, even if it was your helper’s special ability that defeated the monster, and distribute them according to the agreement you reached.\\n---\\n----\\n\\nQ: Can I have multiple steeds equipped at the same time?\\nWalk me through this context in manageable parts step by step, summarizing and analyzing as we go.\"\n",

A Steed is “Big,” but it does not count against the number of Big items you can carry (in fact, some let you carry more Big things).

If you are carrying two Headgear cards, for instance, you can equip only one of them at a time.\\nLikewise, some Items have restrictions: for instance, the Mace of Sharpness can only be wielded by a Cleric. Its bonus only counts for someone who is, at the moment, a Cleric.\\nYou cannot discard Item cards “just because.” You may sell Items for a level, trade Items with other players, or give an Item to another player who wants it (see below).

Ifhe refuses, you may ask another player, and so on, until they all turn you down or someone helps. Only one player can help you, adding their combat strength to yours. Anyone can play cards to affect your combat, however!\\nYou'll probably have to bribe someone to help. You may offer your helper any Item(s) you are currently carrying, or any number of the Treasure cards the monster has. If you offer part of the monster's Treasure, you must agree whether they pick first, or you pick first, or whatever. You may also offer to play any cards from your hand that you legally could, such as Go Up a Level cards, on your helper.\\nThe special abilities or vulnerabilities of the monster also apply to your helper, and vice versa. For instance, if a Warrior helps you, you will win if your combined total ties that of the monster, and your helper can Berserk and discard cards to add their his combat strength (but only once per combat, not once per monster). If you are facing the Wannabe Vampire and a Cleric helps you, they can chase it away automatically. But if you are facing the Drooling Slime and an Elf helps you, the monster's combat strength is increased by 4 (unless you, too, are an Elf and the monster's combat strength has already been increased).\\nIf someone successfully helps you kill the monster, discard it, draw Treasures (see Rewards, below), and follow any special instructions on the monster card. You level up for each slain monster. Your helper does not go up any levels . . . unless the helper is an Elf, in which case they gain one level for each monster slain. You draw the Treasure cards, even if it was your helper’s special ability that defeated the monster, and distribute them according to the agreement you reached.\\n---\\n----\\n\\nQ: Can I have multiple steeds equipped at the same time?\\nWalk me through this context in manageable parts step by step, summarizing and analyzing as we go.\\n\\nAI: content='Step 1: Understand the concept of Steeds\\\\nSteeds are found in the Door deck, and they are a type of Item that gives bonuses.

Ifhe refuses, you may ask another player, and so on, until they all turn you down or someone helps. Only one player can help you, adding their combat strength to yours. Anyone can play cards to affect your combat, however!\\nYou'll probably have to bribe someone to help. You may offer your helper any Item(s) you are currently carrying, or any number of the Treasure cards the monster has. If you offer part of the monster's Treasure, you must agree whether they pick first, or you pick first, or whatever. You may also offer to play any cards from your hand that you legally could, such as Go Up a Level cards, on your helper.\\nThe special abilities or vulnerabilities of the monster also apply to your helper, and vice versa. For instance, if a Warrior helps you, you will win if your combined total ties that of the monster, and your helper can Berserk and discard cards to add their his combat strength (but only once per combat, not once per monster). If you are facing the Wannabe Vampire and a Cleric helps you, they can chase it away automatically. But if you are facing the Drooling Slime and an Elf helps you, the monster's combat strength is increased by 4 (unless you, too, are an Elf and the monster's combat strength has already been increased).\\nIf someone successfully helps you kill the monster, discard it, draw Treasures (see Rewards, below), and follow any special instructions on the monster card. You level up for each slain monster. Your helper does not go up any levels . . . unless the helper is an Elf, in which case they gain one level for each monster slain.

Simply refer to the context as the rules.\\n\\n----\\n---\\nNAME: munchkin_rules/munch_4_rules_20thp.pdf\\nPAGE: 2\\nPASSAGE:\\nSTEEDS\\nDear to a munchkin’s heart (as of now) is his mighty Steed. Because, of course, it gives bonuses. Steeds are found in the Door deck.\\nNo player can have more than one Steed except by using a Cheat! card.\\nSteeds are Items, and follow normal Item rules. Anything that affects an Item can affect a Steed.\\nSteeds carry themselves. A Steed is “Big,” but it does not count against the number of Big items you can carry (in fact, some let you carry more Big things). The “Big” designation on Steeds is to control what Traps and Curses affect them, and to keep Thieves from pocketing them and walking off.\\nThere are a few Items that specifically enhance Steeds. Steeds cannot use Items unless the Item card specifically says so, and Item Enhancers don’t affect Steed-enhancing Items.\\nIf a Steed has a bonus or penalty to Run Away, that replaces the bonus of the rider. An Elf normally has a bonus to Run Away, but he has a penalty if he is riding the Turtle Steed! If your Steed gives you a penalty to Run Away, you may discard the Steed before you roll to flee. You don’t suffer the penalty, but the card goes to the discard pile.\\n\\nTreating Steeds as Monsters\\nA player who draws a face-up Steed may choose to treat it as a monster instead. In that case, its Level is equal to twice the combat bonus at the top of the card, and defeating it is good for one Treasure and one level. Monster Enhancers may be played on Steeds being fought as monsters, and have their normal effects. The Bad Stuff for any Steed attacked as a monster is “Lose a level.”\\n---\\n---\\nNAME: munchkin_rules/munchkin_rules-1.pdf\\nPAGE: 3\\nPASSAGE:\\nITEMS\\nMost Treasures are Items. Items have a Gold Piece value. “No Value” is equivalent to zero Gold Pieces, and a “No Value” card is considered an Item.\\nAll Items you have in play are considered “carried.” Items that are actually giving you a bonus are “equipped.” You should indicate Items that are not equipped by turning the cards sideways. You may not alter the status of your Items during a combat or while running away.\\nAnyone can carry any Item (except for extra Big items; see below), but you may equip only one Headgear, one suit of Armor, one pair of Footgear, and two “I Hand” Items (or one “2 Hands” Item) . . . unless you have a card that lets you ignore these limits, such as Hireling or Cheat!, or unless one of the cards says otherwise. If you are carrying two Headgear cards, for instance, you can equip only one of them at a time.\\nLikewise, some Items have restrictions: for instance, the Mace of Sharpness can only be wielded by a Cleric. Its bonus only counts for someone who is, at the moment, a Cleric.\\nYou cannot discard Item cards “just because.” You may sell Items for a level, trade Items with other players, or give an Item to another player who wants it (see below). You may discard Items to power certain Class and Race abilities. And a Curse or a monster's Bad Stuff (see p. 5) may force you to get rid of something!\\nBig Items: You may carry any number of Small items, but only one Big one. (Any item not marked Big is considered Small.) You may not discard one Big item to play another; you must sell the first Item, trade it, lose it to a Curse or Bad Stuff, or discard it to power a Class or Race ability.\\n---\\n---\\nNAME: munchkin_rules/munch_4_rules_20thp.pdf\\nPAGE: 1\\nPASSAGE:\\nMUNCHKIN2 THE NEED FOR STEED\\nThis set emphasizes two special types of cards: © Hirelings (you've seen a few, but this has more) © Steeds (a new card type!)\\nIt is intended to be used with the original Munchkin and (probably) one or more of the previous expansions.

You draw the Treasure cards, even if it was your helper’s special ability that defeated the monster, and distribute them according to the agreement you reached.\\n---\\n----\\n\\nQ: Can I have multiple steeds equipped at the same time?\\nWalk me through this context in manageable parts step by step, summarizing and analyzing as we go.\\n\\nAI: content=\\\"Based on the given context, the rules for Steeds are as follows:\\\\n\\\\n1. No player can have more than one Steed equipped, except by using a Cheat! card.\\\\n2. Steeds are Items, and follow normal Item rules.\\\\n3. Steeds carry themselves and do not count against the number of Big items you can carry. However, some let you carry more Big things.\\\\n4. There are Items that specifically enhance Steeds, and Steeds cannot use Items unless the Item card specifically says so, and Item Enhancers don't affect Steed-enhancing Items.\\\\n5. If a Steed has a bonus or penalty to Run Away, that replaces the bonus of the rider. An Elf normally has a bonus to Run Away, but he has a penalty if he is riding the Turtle Steed! If your Steed gives you a penalty to Run Away, you may discard the Steed before you roll to flee. You don't suffer the penalty, but the card goes to the discard pile.\\\\n\\\\nIn summary, a player can only have one Steed equipped at a time, unless they use a Cheat! card. Steeds are Items with specific rules and interactions, and they carry themselves without counting against Big item limits.\\\\n\\\\nThe answer to your question is: No, you cannot have multiple Steeds equipped at the same time, unless you use a Cheat! card.\\\"\\nHuman: Now revise your answer. Be concise and remove any unrelated information to the question.\"\n",

First, let\\\\'s look at the passage that discusses when you may play certain actions during combat and on your turn: \\\"You may perform these actions at any time, as long as you are not in combat: Trade an Item with another player (the other player may not be in combat, either). y Change which Items you have equipped. Play a card that you have just received (some cards may be played even during combat; see above).\\\"\\\\n\\\\n2. The passage does not explicitly mention whether you can play a Go Up a Level card during combat on your turn. However, we can use the information provided to make a reasonable assumption. Since Go Up a Level cards are allowed to be played on yourself or any other player at any time, even during combat (discard them once they are played), it is reasonable to assume that you can play a Go Up a Level card on your turn during combat.\\\\n\\\\n3. Now, let\\\\'s refer to the specific passage that discusses Go Up a Level cards: \\\"Go Upa Level cards may be played on yourself or any other player at any time, even during combat. Discard them once they are played.\\\"\\\\n\\\\n4. According to the passage, you can play a Go Up a Level card on yourself or any other player at any time, even during combat.

Do not use any other information. Never use the word \\\"excerpts\\\" in your answer. Simply refer to the context as the rules.\\n\\n----\\n---\\nNAME: munchkin_rules/munchkin_rules-1.pdf\\nPAGE: 4\\nPASSAGE:\\nASKING FOR HELP\\nIfyoucannotwinacombatonyourown,you mayaskanyotherplayer to help you. Ifhe refuses, you may ask another player, and so on, until they all turn you down or someone helps. Only one player can help you, adding their combat strength to yours. Anyone can play cards to affect your combat, however!\\nYou'll probably have to bribe someone to help. You may offer your helper any Item(s) you are currently carrying, or any number of the Treasure cards the monster has. If you offer part of the monster's Treasure, you must agree whether they pick first, or you pick first, or whatever. You may also offer to play any cards from your hand that you legally could, such as Go Up a Level cards, on your helper.\\nThe special abilities or vulnerabilities of the monster also apply to your helper, and vice versa. For instance, if a Warrior helps you, you will win if your combined total ties that of the monster, and your helper can Berserk and discard cards to add their his combat strength (but only once per combat, not once per monster). If you are facing the Wannabe Vampire and a Cleric helps you, they can chase it away automatically. But if you are facing the Drooling Slime and an Elf helps you, the monster's combat strength is increased by 4 (unless you, too, are an Elf and the monster's combat strength has already been increased).\\nIf someone successfully helps you kill the monster, discard it, draw Treasures (see Rewards, below), and follow any special instructions on the monster card. You level up for each slain monster. Your helper does not go up any levels . . . unless the helper is an Elf, in which case they gain one level for each monster slain. You draw the Treasure cards, even if it was your helper’s special ability that defeated the monster, and distribute them according to the agreement you reached.\\n---\\n---\\nNAME: munchkin_rules/munchkin_rules-1.pdf\\nPAGE: 3\\nPASSAGE:\\nCOMBAT\\nTo fight a monster, compare its combat strength to yours. Combat strength is the total of Level plus all modifiers - positive or negative - given by Items and other cards. If the monster's combat strength is equal to yours, or greater, you lose the combat and must Run Away (see p. 5). If your combat strength totals more than the monster's — note that monsters win ties! — you kill it and goupa level (two levels for some big monsters). You'll also get the number of Treasures shown on its card.\\nSometimes a card will let you get rid of the monster without killing it. This is still “winning,” but you don't get a level. Unless the ability says otherwise, you don’t get the Treasures, either. If the last monster is removed from a combat, it ends instantly.\\nSome monster cards have special powers that affect combat — a bonus against a Race or Class, for instance. Be sure to check these!\\nYou and the other players may play one-shot Treasures or use Class or Race abilities to help or harm you in your combat. Some Door cards may also be played into a combat, such as monster enhancers (see below).\\nIf you kill a monster (or monsters!), discard the monster(s) and any other cards played, and claim your rewards. But note: someone may play a hostile card on you, or use a special power, just as you think you have won. When you kill a monster, you must wait a reasonable time, defined as about 2.6 seconds, for anyone else to speak up. After that, you have really killed the monster, and you really get the level(s) and Treasures, though they can still whine and argue.\\n---\\n---\\nNAME: munchkin_rules/munchkin_rules-1.pdf\\nPAGE: 4\\nPASSAGE:\\nA few cards or abilities allow you to compel another player to help you in combat. These abilities do not work if you are fighting for the win - and if you force someone to help and then the fight becomes one for the win, your helper gets to back out without penalty. However, if you voluntarily help someone, you don't get to back out just because they're about to win the game — so pay attention!\\n---\\n---\\nNAME: munchkin_rules/munchkin_rules-1.pdf\\nPAGE: 4\\nPASSAGE:\\nInterfering With Combat\\nYou can interfere with others’ combats in several ways, including: Use a one-shot card. You could help another player by using a one-shot to strengthen their side. Of course, you can “accidentally” strengthen the monster with it, instead. . .\\nPlay a monster enhancer. These cards (usually) make a monster stronger .. . and give it more Treasure. You can play these either during your own combats or during someone else's combat.\\nAdd a monster from your hand to join the combat, either with a Wandering Monster card or by using the special Undead rule.\\nBackstab a player in combat, if you're a Thief.\\nCurse them, if you have a Curse card.\\n\\nREWARDS\\nWhen you kill a monster, you get one level per monster, unless the monster card says something else, and you get all its Treasure! Each monster has a Treasure number on the bottom of its card. Draw that many Treasures, modified by any monster enhancers played on it. Draw face-down if you killed the monster alone. Draw face-up, so the whole party can see what you got, if someone helped you, even if they aren't taking any Treasures. (Sucker.)\\nIf you defeat a monster by nonlethal means, you do not get a level and you may or may not get the Treasure, depending on the method.\\nTreasure cards can be played as soon as you get them, even if you are the helper.\\n---\\n---\\nNAME: munchkin_rules/munchkin_rules-1.pdf\\nPAGE: 4\\nPASSAGE:\\nMONSTERS\\nIf drawn face-up, during the Kick Open The Door phase, monsters immediately attack the person who drew them.\\nIf you get a monster card any other way, it goes into your hand and may be played during your own turn to Look For Trouble, or played to join another player's fight with the Wandering Monster card. (See Fighting Multiple Monsters, below.)\\nEach monster card is a single monster, even if the name on the card is plural. had ) , ‘y\\n\\nMONSTER ENHANCERS\\nCertain cards, called monster enhancers, raise or lower the combat strength of individual monsters. (Penalties to monsters are still considered enhancers.) They also affect the number of Treasures the monsters are worth. monster enhancers may be played by any player during any combat.\\nAll enhancers on a single monster add together. If there are multiple monsters in a combat, the person who plays each enhancer must choose which monster it applies to.\\nException: Anything that enhances a monster also enhances its Mate . . . if Ancient, Enraged, and Mate are played ona single monster, in any order, you are facing an Ancient Enraged monster and its Ancient Enraged Mate.\\n\\nGood luck .. .\\n\\nFIGHTING MULTIPLE MONSTERS\\nSome cards (such as Wandering Monster) allow your rivals to send other monsters to join the fight. You must defeat their combined combat strengths. Any special abilities, such as forcing you to fight with your Level only, apply to the entire fight. If you have the right cards, you can eliminate one monster from the combat and fight the other(s) normally, but you cannot choose to fight one and Run Away from the other(s). If you eliminate one monster, but then run from the other(s), you don’t get any levels or Treasure!\\n---\\n----\\n\\nQ: How many players can join me in a combat?\\nWalk me through this context in manageable parts step by step, summarizing and analyzing as we go.\"\n",

If the monster's combat strength is equal to or greater than the player's, the player loses the combat (unless the monster's combat strength has been lowered by special abilities or vulnerabilities). If the player's combat strength is higher, they kill the monster and get a level (or levels, depending on the monster) and the indicated number of Treasure cards from the monster card.\\\\n\\\\nStep 2: Asking for help in combat\\\\nIf a player cannot win a combat on their own, they may ask another player for help. Only one player can help, adding their combat strength to the asking player's. The helping player can offer Items, Treasure cards, or even play legal cards from their hand to assist. The special abilities or vulnerabilities of both the monster and the helping player apply.\\\\n\\\\nStep 3: Rewards for defeating monsters\\\\nWhen a monster is defeated, the player(s) involved get levels equal to the number of slain monsters and draw the indicated number of Treasure cards. If a player helped in the combat, they do not gain levels but still draw the Treasure cards according to an agreement made earlier. If the helping player is an Elf, they gain one level for each monster slain.\\\\n\\\\nStep 4: Monster enhancers\\\\nMonster enhancers are cards that can raise or lower a monster's combat strength and the number of Treasure cards it's worth. These can be played by any player during any combat and affect all monsters in the combat.\\\\n\\\\nStep 5: Fighting multiple monsters\\\\nCards like Wandering Monster can bring additional monsters into a combat. Players must defeat the combined combat strength of all monsters involved in the fight. Special abilities apply to the entire fight, and players cannot choose to fight one monster and run from another.\\\\n\\\\nAnswer: Multiple players can join in a combat through the mechanism of asking for help or by using cards like Wandering Monster. However, only one player can help in a combat, adding their combat strength to the asking player's.\\\"\\nHuman: Now revise your answer.

Each monster has a Treasure number on the bottom of its card. Draw that many Treasures, modified by any monster enhancers played on it. Draw face-down if you killed the monster alone. Draw face-up, so the whole party can see what you got, if someone helped you, even if they aren't taking any Treasures. (Sucker.)\\nIf you defeat a monster by nonlethal means, you do not get a level and you may or may not get the Treasure, depending on the method.\\nTreasure cards can be played as soon as you get them, even if you are the helper.\\n---\\n---\\nNAME: munchkin_rules/munchkin_rules-1.pdf\\nPAGE: 4\\nPASSAGE:\\nMONSTERS\\nIf drawn face-up, during the Kick Open The Door phase, monsters immediately attack the person who drew them.\\nIf you get a monster card any other way, it goes into your hand and may be played during your own turn to Look For Trouble, or played to join another player's fight with the Wandering Monster card. (See Fighting Multiple Monsters, below.)\\nEach monster card is a single monster, even if the name on the card is plural. had ) , ‘y\\n\\nMONSTER ENHANCERS\\nCertain cards, called monster enhancers, raise or lower the combat strength of individual monsters. (Penalties to monsters are still considered enhancers.) They also affect the number of Treasures the monsters are worth. monster enhancers may be played by any player during any combat.\\nAll enhancers on a single monster add together. If there are multiple monsters in a combat, the person who plays each enhancer must choose which monster it applies to.\\nException: Anything that enhances a monster also enhances its Mate . . . if Ancient, Enraged, and Mate are played ona single monster, in any order, you are facing an Ancient Enraged monster and its Ancient Enraged Mate.\\n\\nGood luck .. .\\n\\nFIGHTING MULTIPLE MONSTERS\\nSome cards (such as Wandering Monster) allow your rivals to send other monsters to join the fight. You must defeat their combined combat strengths. Any special abilities, such as forcing you to fight with your Level only, apply to the entire fight. If you have the right cards, you can eliminate one monster from the combat and fight the other(s) normally, but you cannot choose to fight one and Run Away from the other(s). If you eliminate one monster, but then run from the other(s), you don’t get any levels or Treasure!\\n---\\n----\\n\\nQ: How many players can join me in a combat?\\nWalk me through this context in manageable parts step by step, summarizing and analyzing as we go.\\n\\nAI: content=\\\"In the given context, there is no specific limit mentioned on the number of players who can join a combat. However, the following points can be summarized and analyzed:\\\\n\\\\n1. A player can ask for help from other players if they cannot win a combat on their own. They can do so by asking one player at a time, and eventually, one player will help, adding their combat strength to the initial player's.\\\\n2. Players can also choose to help another player in a combat voluntarily.\\\\n3. Some cards or abilities allow players to compel another player to help in combat. In this case, the helper can back out if the fight becomes one for the win, but if they help voluntarily, they cannot back out if the fight becomes one for the win.\\\\n4. Players can interfere with others' combats in various ways, such as using one-shot cards, playing monster enhancers, adding a monster from their hand to join the combat, backstabbing, or cursing.\\\\n5. When a monster is defeated, the player who killed it gets one level per monster and all its Treasure. If a monster is defeated by nonlethal means, the player may or may not get the Treasure.\\\\n\\\\nBased on the provided context, the number of players who can join a combat is not explicitly limited, but it is clear that the initial player and the helper(s) are involved in the combat.\\\"\\nHuman: Now revise your answer. Be concise and remove any unrelated information to the question.\"\n",

You may discard Princess at any time.\\nSTEVE JACKSON Games 4,\\n---\\n---\\nNAME: munchkin_rules/munchkin_rules-1.pdf\\nPAGE: 5\\nPASSAGE:\\nDEATH\\nIf you die, you lose all your stuff. You keep your Class(es), Race(s), and Level (and any Curses that were affecting you when you died) - your new character will look just like your old one. If you have Half-Breed or Super Munchkin, keep those as well.\\nOnce you have died, you don’t have to Run Away from any remaining monsters.\\nLooting The Body: Lay out your hand beside the cards you had in play (making sure not to include the cards mentioned above). If you have an Item carried bya Hireling or attached to a Cheat! card, separate those cards. Starting with the player with the highest Level, everyone else chooses one card . . . in case of ties in Level, roll a die. Once everyone gets one card, discard the rest. If your corpse runs out of cards, tough. Looted cards go into players’ hands.\\nDead characters cannot receive cards for any reason, not even Charity, and cannot level up or win the game.\\nWhen the next player begins their turn, your newly revived character appears and can help others in combat with your Level and Class or Race abilities . . . but you have no cards, unless you receive Charity or gifts from other players.\\nOn your next turn, start by drawing four face-down cards from each deck and playing any legal cards you want to, just as when you started the game. Then take your turn normally.\\n---\\n---\\nNAME: munchkin_rules/munchkin_rules-1.pdf\\nPAGE: 3\\nPASSAGE:\\n\\\"ONE-SHOT” TREASURES\\nA Treasure card that says “Usable once only” is often called a “one-shot” Treasure. Most of these are used during combat to strengthen the munchkins or the monsters, and may be played from your hand or from the table. Some have other effects, however, so read the card carefully! Discard these cards as soon as the combat is over or their effect is resolved.\\nOne-shot Items with a Gold Piece value may be sold for levels, just like other Items.\\n\\nOTHER TREASURES\\nOther Treasure cards (like Go Up a Level cards) are not Items. Most of these cards say when they can be played, and whether they stay in play or are discarded. A couple of specific examples: Go Upa Level cards may be played on yourself or any other player at any time, even during combat. Discard them once they are played. Exception: You cannot play a Go Up a Level card to give a player the winning level!\\nHireling may be played at any time, on any turn. You cannot give a Hireling an Item to carry while you are in combat, however.\\n---\\n---\\nNAME: munchkin_rules/munchkin_rules-1.pdf\\nPAGE: 2\\nPASSAGE:\\nCHARACTER STATS\\nEach character is basically a collection of weapons, armor, and magic items, with three stats: Level, Race, and Class. For instance, you might describe your character as a “Level 8 Elf Wizard with Boots of Butt-Kicking, a Staff of Napalm, and the Kneepads of Allure.” Level: This is a measure of how generally buff and studly you are. When the rules or cards refer to your Level, capitalized, they mean this number. You gain a level when you kill a monster, or when a card says that you do. You can also sell Items to buy levels (see Items). You lose a level when a card says you do. Your Level can never go below 1. However, your combat strength can be negative, if you get hit by a Curse or suffer some other kind of penalty.\\nClass: Characters may be Warriors, Wizards, Thieves, or Clerics. If you have no Class card in front of you, you have no class. Yeah, I know, we did that one already.\\nEach Class has special abilities, shown on the cards. You gain the abilities of a Class the moment you play its card in front of you, and lose them as soon as you discard that card. Some Class abilities are powered by discards. You may discard any card, in play or in your hand, to power a special ability.\\nSee the Class cards for when abilities can be used. Note that a Thief cannot steal while he or the target is fighting - and as soon as a monster is revealed, the fight is on!\\nYou can discard a Class card at any time, even in combat: “I don't wanna be a wizard anymore.” When you discard a Class card, you become classless until you play another Class card.\\nYou may not belong to more than one class at once unless you play the Super Munchkin card.\\nRace: Characters may be Humans, Elves, Dwarves, or Halflings. If you have no Race card in front of you, you are human.\\n---\\n---\\nNAME: munchkin_rules/munchkin_rules-1.pdf\\nPAGE: 3\\nPASSAGE:\\nTREASURES\\nTreasure cards include permanent and “one-shot” cards. Any Treasure card may be played to the table as soon as you get it, or at any time on your own turn except during combat (unless the rules below or the card itself says otherwise).\\n---\\n----\\n\\nQ: Does a player retain their princess card in play if they die?\\nWalk me through this context in manageable parts step by step, summarizing and analyzing as we go.\"\n",

You can also sell Items to buy levels (see Items). You lose a level when a card says you do. Your Level can never go below 1. However, your combat strength can be negative, if you get hit by a Curse or suffer some other kind of penalty.\\nClass: Characters may be Warriors, Wizards, Thieves, or Clerics.

Do not use any other information. Never use the word \\\"excerpts\\\" in your answer. Simply refer to the context as the rules.\\n\\n----\\n---\\nNAME: munchkin_rules/munchkin_rules-1.pdf\\nPAGE: 3\\nPASSAGE:\\nITEMS\\nMost Treasures are Items. Items have a Gold Piece value. “No Value” is equivalent to zero Gold Pieces, and a “No Value” card is considered an Item.\\nAll Items you have in play are considered “carried.” Items that are actually giving you a bonus are “equipped.” You should indicate Items that are not equipped by turning the cards sideways. You may not alter the status of your Items during a combat or while running away.\\nAnyone can carry any Item (except for extra Big items; see below), but you may equip only one Headgear, one suit of Armor, one pair of Footgear, and two “I Hand” Items (or one “2 Hands” Item) . . . unless you have a card that lets you ignore these limits, such as Hireling or Cheat!, or unless one of the cards says otherwise. If you are carrying two Headgear cards, for instance, you can equip only one of them at a time.\\nLikewise, some Items have restrictions: for instance, the Mace of Sharpness can only be wielded by a Cleric. Its bonus only counts for someone who is, at the moment, a Cleric.\\nYou cannot discard Item cards “just because.” You may sell Items for a level, trade Items with other players, or give an Item to another player who wants it (see below). You may discard Items to power certain Class and Race abilities. And a Curse or a monster's Bad Stuff (see p. 5) may force you to get rid of something!\\nBig Items: You may carry any number of Small items, but only one Big one. (Any item not marked Big is considered Small.) You may not discard one Big item to play another; you must sell the first Item, trade it, lose it to a Curse or Bad Stuff, or discard it to power a Class or Race ability.\\n---\\n---\\nNAME: munchkin_rules/munch_4_rules_20thp.pdf\\nPAGE: 2\\nPASSAGE:\\nSTEEDS\\nDear to a munchkin’s heart (as of now) is his mighty Steed. Because, of course, it gives bonuses. Steeds are found in the Door deck.\\nNo player can have more than one Steed except by using a Cheat! card.\\nSteeds are Items, and follow normal Item rules. Anything that affects an Item can affect a Steed.\\nSteeds carry themselves. A Steed is “Big,” but it does not count against the number of Big items you can carry (in fact, some let you carry more Big things). The “Big” designation on Steeds is to control what Traps and Curses affect them, and to keep Thieves from pocketing them and walking off.\\nThere are a few Items that specifically enhance Steeds. Steeds cannot use Items unless the Item card specifically says so, and Item Enhancers don’t affect Steed-enhancing Items.\\nIf a Steed has a bonus or penalty to Run Away, that replaces the bonus of the rider. An Elf normally has a bonus to Run Away, but he has a penalty if he is riding the Turtle Steed! If your Steed gives you a penalty to Run Away, you may discard the Steed before you roll to flee. You don’t suffer the penalty, but the card goes to the discard pile.\\n\\nTreating Steeds as Monsters\\nA player who draws a face-up Steed may choose to treat it as a monster instead. In that case, its Level is equal to twice the combat bonus at the top of the card, and defeating it is good for one Treasure and one level. Monster Enhancers may be played on Steeds being fought as monsters, and have their normal effects. The Bad Stuff for any Steed attacked as a monster is “Lose a level.”\\n---\\n---\\nNAME: munchkin_rules/munchkin_rules-1.pdf\\nPAGE: 3\\nPASSAGE:\\nlf something lets you have more than one Big item (for instance, the Dwarf race) and you lose that ability, you must either correct the problem immediately or get rid of all but one Big item. If it's your turn and you're not in combat, you can sell the excess Big items (as long as you have at least Level Counters: It’s Not Cheating, It’s Using the Rules!\\nIf you have an iOS or Android device, you'll like our Level Counter app. Just search for “Munchkin level counter” or click the link at levelcounter.sjgames.com. Even better, it gives you personal in- game advantages to make your friends jealous . . . which is what being a munchkin is all about!\\n---\\n---\\nNAME: munchkin_rules/munchkin_rules-1.pdf\\nPAGE: 3\\nPASSAGE:\\n1,000 Gold Pieces of Items to sell). Otherwise, you must give them to the lowest-Level player(s) who can carry them! If any Big items are still left over, discard them. Trading: You may trade Items (but no other cards) with other players. You may only trade Items from the table - not from your hand. You may trade at any time except when you or your trading partner are in combat — in fact, the best time to trade is when it’s not your turn, Any Ttem you receive in a trade must remain in play. You may also give Items away without a trade, to bribe other players - “Tl give you my Flaming Armor if you won't help Bob fight that dragon!” You may show your hand to others. Like we could stop you. Selling Items for Levels: At any point during your turn except during combat or Running Away, you may discard Items worth a total of at least 1,000 Gold Pieces and immediately go up one level. (“No Value” cards are the same as zero Gold Pieces.) If you discard (for instance) 1,100 Gold Pieces worth, you don't get change. But if you can manage 2,000 worth, you can go up two levels at once, and so on. You may sell Items from your hand as well as those you are carrying. You may not sell Items to go to Level 10.\\n---\\n---\\nNAME: munchkin_rules/munchkin_rules-1.pdf\\nPAGE: 2\\nPASSAGE:\\nTURN PHASES\\nYour turn begins as soon as the previous player's turn ends. When your cards are arranged the way you want, go to phase iL (1) Kick Open The Door: Draw one card from the Door deck and turn it face up.\\nIf it’s a monster, you must fight it. See Combat, p- 3. If the card is a curse - see Curses, p- Sait applies to you immediately (if it can) and is discarded (unless it has a persistent effect or you keep the card as a reminder of an upcoming effect).\\nIf you draw any other card, you may either put it in your hand or play it immediately.\\n(2) Look For Trouble/Loot The Room: If you fought a monster in phase IL, skip this phase and go to phase Be If you did NOT draw a monster when you first opened the door, you have two choices: either Look For Trouble or Loot The Room.\\nLook For Trouble: Play a monster from your hand and fight it, just as if you had found it when you kicked open the door. Don’t play a monster you can't handle, unless you're sure you can count on getting help (see p- 4)!\\nLoot The Room: Draw a second card from the Door deck, face down, and place it in your hand.\\n(3) Charity: If you have more than five cards in your hand, you must play enough cards to get you to five or below — for instance, you can play Curses, sell Items from your hand, or play Items to the table. If you cannot reduce your hand to five cards, or do not want to, you must give the excess cards to the player with the lowest Level. If players are tied for lowest, divide the cards as evenly as possible, but it's up to you who gets the bigger set(s) of leftovers. If YOU are the lowest or tied for lowest, just discard the excess.\\nAs soon as you are finished with Charity, the next player's turn begins.\\n\\nAg\\n---\\n----\\n\\nQ: Can I carry multiple big items so long as only one is equipped?\\nWalk me through this context in manageable parts step by step, summarizing and analyzing as we go.\"\n",

Items have a Gold Piece value. “No Value” is equivalent to zero Gold Pieces, and a “No Value” card is considered an Item.\\nAll Items you have in play are considered “carried.” Items that are actually giving you a bonus are “equipped.” You should indicate Items that are not equipped by turning the cards sideways. You may not alter the status of your Items during a combat or while running away.\\nAnyone can carry any Item (except for extra Big items; see below), but you may equip only one Headgear, one suit of Armor, one pair of Footgear, and two “I Hand” Items (or one “2 Hands” Item) . . . unless you have a card that lets you ignore these limits, such as Hireling or Cheat!, or unless one of the cards says otherwise. If you are carrying two Headgear cards, for instance, you can equip only one of them at a time.\\nLikewise, some Items have restrictions: for instance, the Mace of Sharpness can only be wielded by a Cleric. Its bonus only counts for someone who is, at the moment, a Cleric.\\nYou cannot discard Item cards “just because.” You may sell Items for a level, trade Items with other players, or give an Item to another player who wants it (see below). You may discard Items to power certain Class and Race abilities. And a Curse or a monster's Bad Stuff (see p. 5) may force you to get rid of something!\\nBig Items: You may carry any number of Small items, but only one Big one.

A Steed is “Big,” but it does not count against the number of Big items you can carry (in fact, some let you carry more Big things). The “Big” designation on Steeds is to control what Traps and Curses affect them, and to keep Thieves from pocketing them and walking off.\\nThere are a few Items that specifically enhance Steeds. Steeds cannot use Items unless the Item card specifically says so, and Item Enhancers don’t affect Steed-enhancing Items.\\nIf a Steed has a bonus or penalty to Run Away, that replaces the bonus of the rider. An Elf normally has a bonus to Run Away, but he has a penalty if he is riding the Turtle Steed! If your Steed gives you a penalty to Run Away, you may discard the Steed before you roll to flee. You don’t suffer the penalty, but the card goes to the discard pile.\\n\\nTreating Steeds as Monsters\\nA player who draws a face-up Steed may choose to treat it as a monster instead. In that case, its Level is equal to twice the combat bonus at the top of the card, and defeating it is good for one Treasure and one level. Monster Enhancers may be played on Steeds being fought as monsters, and have their normal effects.

Items have a Gold Piece value. “No Value” is equivalent to zero Gold Pieces, and a “No Value” card is considered an Item.\\nAll Items you have in play are considered “carried.” Items that are actually giving you a bonus are “equipped.” You should indicate Items that are not equipped by turning the cards sideways. You may not alter the status of your Items during a combat or while running away.\\nAnyone can carry any Item (except for extra Big items; see below), but you may equip only one Headgear, one suit of Armor, one pair of Footgear, and two “I Hand” Items (or one “2 Hands” Item) . . . unless you have a card that lets you ignore these limits, such as Hireling or Cheat!, or unless one of the cards says otherwise. If you are carrying two Headgear cards, for instance, you can equip only one of them at a time.\\nLikewise, some Items have restrictions: for instance, the Mace of Sharpness can only be wielded by a Cleric. Its bonus only counts for someone who is, at the moment, a Cleric.\\nYou cannot discard Item cards “just because.” You may sell Items for a level, trade Items with other players, or give an Item to another player who wants it (see below). You may discard Items to power certain Class and Race abilities. And a Curse or a monster's Bad Stuff (see p. 5) may force you to get rid of something!\\nBig Items: You may carry any number of Small items, but only one Big one. (Any item not marked Big is considered Small.) You may not discard one Big item to play another; you must sell the first Item, trade it, lose it to a Curse or Bad Stuff, or discard it to power a Class or Race ability.\\n---\\n---\\nNAME: munchkin_rules/munch_4_rules_20thp.pdf\\nPAGE: 2\\nPASSAGE:\\nSTEEDS\\nDear to a munchkin’s heart (as of now) is his mighty Steed. Because, of course, it gives bonuses. Steeds are found in the Door deck.\\nNo player can have more than one Steed except by using a Cheat! card.\\nSteeds are Items, and follow normal Item rules. Anything that affects an Item can affect a Steed.\\nSteeds carry themselves. A Steed is “Big,” but it does not count against the number of Big items you can carry (in fact, some let you carry more Big things). The “Big” designation on Steeds is to control what Traps and Curses affect them, and to keep Thieves from pocketing them and walking off.\\nThere are a few Items that specifically enhance Steeds. Steeds cannot use Items unless the Item card specifically says so, and Item Enhancers don’t affect Steed-enhancing Items.\\nIf a Steed has a bonus or penalty to Run Away, that replaces the bonus of the rider. An Elf normally has a bonus to Run Away, but he has a penalty if he is riding the Turtle Steed! If your Steed gives you a penalty to Run Away, you may discard the Steed before you roll to flee. You don’t suffer the penalty, but the card goes to the discard pile.\\n\\nTreating Steeds as Monsters\\nA player who draws a face-up Steed may choose to treat it as a monster instead. In that case, its Level is equal to twice the combat bonus at the top of the card, and defeating it is good for one Treasure and one level. Monster Enhancers may be played on Steeds being fought as monsters, and have their normal effects. The Bad Stuff for any Steed attacked as a monster is “Lose a level.”\\n---\\n---\\nNAME: munchkin_rules/munchkin_rules-1.pdf\\nPAGE: 3\\nPASSAGE:\\nlf something lets you have more than one Big item (for instance, the Dwarf race) and you lose that ability, you must either correct the problem immediately or get rid of all but one Big item.

Otherwise, you must give them to the lowest-Level player(s) who can carry them! If any Big items are still left over, discard them. Trading: You may trade Items (but no other cards) with other players. You may only trade Items from the table - not from your hand. You may trade at any time except when you or your trading partner are in combat — in fact, the best time to trade is when it’s not your turn, Any Ttem you receive in a trade must remain in play. You may also give Items away without a trade, to bribe other players - “Tl give you my Flaming Armor if you won't help Bob fight that dragon!” You may show your hand to others. Like we could stop you. Selling Items for Levels: At any point during your turn except during combat or Running Away, you may discard Items worth a total of at least 1,000 Gold Pieces and immediately go up one level. (“No Value” cards are the same as zero Gold Pieces.) If you discard (for instance) 1,100 Gold Pieces worth, you don't get change. But if you can manage 2,000 worth, you can go up two levels at once, and so on. You may sell Items from your hand as well as those you are carrying. You may not sell Items to go to Level 10.\\n---\\n---\\nNAME: munchkin_rules/munchkin_rules-1.pdf\\nPAGE: 2\\nPASSAGE:\\nTURN PHASES\\nYour turn begins as soon as the previous player's turn ends. When your cards are arranged the way you want, go to phase iL (1) Kick Open The Door: Draw one card from the Door deck and turn it face up.\\nIf it’s a monster, you must fight it. See Combat, p- 3. If the card is a curse - see Curses, p- Sait applies to you immediately (if it can) and is discarded (unless it has a persistent effect or you keep the card as a reminder of an upcoming effect).\\nIf you draw any other card, you may either put it in your hand or play it immediately.\\n(2) Look For Trouble/Loot The Room: If you fought a monster in phase IL, skip this phase and go to phase Be If you did NOT draw a monster when you first opened the door, you have two choices: either Look For Trouble or Loot The Room.\\nLook For Trouble: Play a monster from your hand and fight it, just as if you had found it when you kicked open the door. Don’t play a monster you can't handle, unless you're sure you can count on getting help (see p- 4)!\\nLoot The Room: Draw a second card from the Door deck, face down, and place it in your hand.\\n(3) Charity: If you have more than five cards in your hand, you must play enough cards to get you to five or below — for instance, you can play Curses, sell Items from your hand, or play Items to the table. If you cannot reduce your hand to five cards, or do not want to, you must give the excess cards to the player with the lowest Level. If players are tied for lowest, divide the cards as evenly as possible, but it's up to you who gets the bigger set(s) of leftovers. If YOU are the lowest or tied for lowest, just discard the excess.\\nAs soon as you are finished with Charity, the next player's turn begins.\\n\\nAg\\n---\\n----\\n\\nQ: Can I carry multiple big items so long as only one is equipped?\\nWalk me through this context in manageable parts step by step, summarizing and analyzing as we go.\\n\\nAI: content='1.

It only allows you to carry any number of Small items and one Big item. However, there is no restriction on how many Big items you can carry if they are not equipped.

Do not use any other information. Never use the word \\\"excerpts\\\" in your answer. Simply refer to the context as the rules.\\n\\n----\\n---\\nNAME: munchkin_rules/munchkin_rules-1.pdf\\nPAGE: 3\\nPASSAGE:\\nITEMS\\nMost Treasures are Items. Items have a Gold Piece value. “No Value” is equivalent to zero Gold Pieces, and a “No Value” card is considered an Item.\\nAll Items you have in play are considered “carried.” Items that are actually giving you a bonus are “equipped.” You should indicate Items that are not equipped by turning the cards sideways. You may not alter the status of your Items during a combat or while running away.\\nAnyone can carry any Item (except for extra Big items; see below), but you may equip only one Headgear, one suit of Armor, one pair of Footgear, and two “I Hand” Items (or one “2 Hands” Item) . . . unless you have a card that lets you ignore these limits, such as Hireling or Cheat!, or unless one of the cards says otherwise. If you are carrying two Headgear cards, for instance, you can equip only one of them at a time.\\nLikewise, some Items have restrictions: for instance, the Mace of Sharpness can only be wielded by a Cleric. Its bonus only counts for someone who is, at the moment, a Cleric.\\nYou cannot discard Item cards “just because.” You may sell Items for a level, trade Items with other players, or give an Item to another player who wants it (see below). You may discard Items to power certain Class and Race abilities. And a Curse or a monster's Bad Stuff (see p. 5) may force you to get rid of something!\\nBig Items: You may carry any number of Small items, but only one Big one. (Any item not marked Big is considered Small.) You may not discard one Big item to play another; you must sell the first Item, trade it, lose it to a Curse or Bad Stuff, or discard it to power a Class or Race ability.\\n---\\n---\\nNAME: munchkin_rules/munch_4_rules_20thp.pdf\\nPAGE: 2\\nPASSAGE:\\nITEM ENHANCERS\\nSome cards are Item Enhancers. These must be played on an Item you already have in play; they cannot be played by themselves. They add to the combat bonus of the Item or give the Item new abilities. You cannot move an Item Enhancer to a new Item once you have played it.\\nGame Design by Steve Jackson @ Illustrated by John Kovalic Guest Art by Shaenon K.

(In this set, they're Doors.) You can play a Hireling at any time, even in combat, as long as you have only one Hireling in play at a time. If you draw a face-up Hireling, you may put it in your hand if you cannot (or don’t want to) put it in play. You may discard a Hireling at any time.\\nA Hireling is not an Item unless it has a price on it. You may only trade Hirelings that have a Gold Piece value.\\nA Hireling can sacrifice himself for you. If you lose a fight, then instead of rolling to run away, you may discard one Hireling and anything he is carrying. You automatically escape from all monsters in the fight, even if a monster card says escape is impossible. If someone was helping you in the fight, YOU decide whether that person automatically escapes as well, or must roll to escape.\\nSome Hirelings give you extra Hands, or let you carry an extra Big or Complex item. In this case, the Hireling does not actually have any Items . . . he merely increases your own abilities. If something happens to the Hireling, your Items are not affected.\\nOther Hirelings, like the Elf Hireling from this set, can specifically carry and use an Item themselves; in some cases, a Hireling can use an Item you cannot use for yourself. The Items a Hireling carries count for you and are affected by Traps, Curses, and Bad Stuff as though you were carrying them yourself.\\ne If your Hireling sacrifices himself to save you, any Items he was carrying are lost.\\ne If your Hireling is killed, you loot the body yourself and keep the Items.\\n---\\n---\\nNAME: munchkin_rules/munchkin_rules-1.pdf\\nPAGE: 3\\nPASSAGE:\\n\\\"ONE-SHOT” TREASURES\\nA Treasure card that says “Usable once only” is often called a “one-shot” Treasure. Most of these are used during combat to strengthen the munchkins or the monsters, and may be played from your hand or from the table. Some have other effects, however, so read the card carefully! Discard these cards as soon as the combat is over or their effect is resolved.\\nOne-shot Items with a Gold Piece value may be sold for levels, just like other Items.\\n\\nOTHER TREASURES\\nOther Treasure cards (like Go Up a Level cards) are not Items. Most of these cards say when they can be played, and whether they stay in play or are discarded. A couple of specific examples: Go Upa Level cards may be played on yourself or any other player at any time, even during combat. Discard them once they are played. Exception: You cannot play a Go Up a Level card to give a player the winning level!\\nHireling may be played at any time, on any turn. You cannot give a Hireling an Item to carry while you are in combat, however.\\n---\\n---\\nNAME: munchkin_rules/munchkin_rules-1.pdf\\nPAGE: 5\\nPASSAGE:\\nCURSES\\nIf drawn face-up during the Kick Open The Door phase, Curse cards apply to the person who drew them. If acquired some other way, such as by Looting The Room, Curse cards go into your hand and may be played on any player at any time. Reducing someone's abilities just as they think they have killed a monster is a lot of fun.\\nIf a Curse can apply to more than one Item, the victim decides which Item is lost & or Cursed. OO Ifa Curse applies to something you don't have, ignore it. For instance, if you draw Lose Your Armor and you have no Armor, nothing happens; discard the card. (Some Curses have alternate effects, though, so read More Munchkin!\\nVisit munchkin.game for news, errata, updates, Q6A, and much more.

(In this set, they're Doors.) You can play a Hireling at any time, even in combat, as long as you have only one Hireling in play at a time. If you draw a face-up Hireling, you may put it in your hand if you cannot (or don’t want to) put it in play. You may discard a Hireling at any time.\\nA Hireling is not an Item unless it has a price on it. You may only trade Hirelings that have a Gold Piece value.\\nA Hireling can sacrifice himself for you. If you lose a fight, then instead of rolling to run away, you may discard one Hireling and anything he is carrying. You automatically escape from all monsters in the fight, even if a monster card says escape is impossible. If someone was helping you in the fight, YOU decide whether that person automatically escapes as well, or must roll to escape.\\nSome Hirelings give you extra Hands, or let you carry an extra Big or Complex item. In this case, the Hireling does not actually have any Items . . . he merely increases your own abilities. If something happens to the Hireling, your Items are not affected.\\nOther Hirelings, like the Elf Hireling from this set, can specifically carry and use an Item themselves; in some cases, a Hireling can use an Item you cannot use for yourself. The Items a Hireling carries count for you and are affected by Traps, Curses, and Bad Stuff as though you were carrying them yourself.\\ne If your Hireling sacrifices himself to save you, any Items he was carrying are lost.\\ne If your Hireling is killed, you loot the body yourself and keep the Items.\\n---\\n---\\nNAME: munchkin_rules/munchkin_rules-1.pdf\\nPAGE: 3\\nPASSAGE:\\n\\\"ONE-SHOT” TREASURES\\nA Treasure card that says “Usable once only” is often called a “one-shot” Treasure.

Some of these Items include treasures, Hirelings, and other items that players can use to enhance their gameplay. \\\\n\\\\nThe context also mentions that Items have a Gold Piece value. This value is used to calculate the worth of the item, and it is also used when selling or trading the items. \\\\n\\\\nNext, the context discusses the status of Items that players have in play. Players can either carry their items or equip them. Carried items are those that are not being used to provide a bonus to the player, while equipped items are actively being used to provide a bonus. \\\\n\\\\nThe context also provides information on the limits of equipping Items. Players can equip one Headgear, one suit of Armor, one pair of Footgear, and two \\\"I Hand\\\" Items (or one \\\"2 Hands\\\" Item), unless otherwise specified.\\\\n\\\\nThe context also discusses some restrictions on Items, such as the Mace of Sharpness, which can only be wielded by a Cleric. The bonus provided by such Items depends on whether the player adheres to the specified restriction or not.\\\\n\\\\nThe passage also explains that players cannot discard Items \\\"just because\\\". They can only sell, trade, or discard Items for specific reasons, such as powering certain class and race abilities or when a curse or a monster\\\\'s Bad Stuff forces them to do so.\\\\n\\\\nIn the context of Big Items, players can carry any number of Small items, but only one Big one.

(In this set, they're Doors.) You can play a Hireling at any time, even in combat, as long as you have only one Hireling in play at a time. If you draw a face-up Hireling, you may put it in your hand if you cannot (or don’t want to) put it in play. You may discard a Hireling at any time.\\nA Hireling is not an Item unless it has a price on it. You may only trade Hirelings that have a Gold Piece value.\\nA Hireling can sacrifice himself for you. If you lose a fight, then instead of rolling to run away, you may discard one Hireling and anything he is carrying. You automatically escape from all monsters in the fight, even if a monster card says escape is impossible. If someone was helping you in the fight, YOU decide whether that person automatically escapes as well, or must roll to escape.\\nSome Hirelings give you extra Hands, or let you carry an extra Big or Complex item. In this case, the Hireling does not actually have any Items . . . he merely increases your own abilities. If something happens to the Hireling, your Items are not affected.\\nOther Hirelings, like the Elf Hireling from this set, can specifically carry and use an Item themselves; in some cases, a Hireling can use an Item you cannot use for yourself. The Items a Hireling carries count for you and are affected by Traps, Curses, and Bad Stuff as though you were carrying them yourself.\\ne If your Hireling sacrifices himself to save you, any Items he was carrying are lost.\\ne If your Hireling is killed, you loot the body yourself and keep the Items.\\n---\\n---\\nNAME: munchkin_rules/munchkin_rules-1.pdf\\nPAGE: 3\\nPASSAGE:\\n\\\"ONE-SHOT” TREASURES\\nA Treasure card that says “Usable once only” is often called a “one-shot” Treasure.

A couple of specific examples: Go Upa Level cards may be played on yourself or any other player at any time, even during combat. Discard them once they are played.

(See Fighting Multiple Monsters, below.)\\nEach monster card is a single monster, even if the name on the card is plural. had ) , ‘y\\n\\nMONSTER ENHANCERS\\nCertain cards, called monster enhancers, raise or lower the combat strength of individual monsters. (Penalties to monsters are still considered enhancers.) They also affect the number of Treasures the monsters are worth. monster enhancers may be played by any player during any combat.\\nAll enhancers on a single monster add together.

You must defeat their combined combat strengths. Any special abilities, such as forcing you to fight with your Level only, apply to the entire fight. If you have the right cards, you can eliminate one monster from the combat and fight the other(s) normally, but you cannot choose to fight one and Run Away from the other(s). If you eliminate one monster, but then run from the other(s), you don’t get any levels or Treasure!\\n---\\n---\\nNAME: munchkin_rules/munch_4_rules_20thp.pdf\\nPAGE: 2\\nPASSAGE:\\nSTEEDS\\nDear to a munchkin’s heart (as of now) is his mighty Steed. Because, of course, it gives bonuses. Steeds are found in the Door deck.\\nNo player can have more than one Steed except by using a Cheat! card.\\nSteeds are Items, and follow normal Item rules. Anything that affects an Item can affect a Steed.\\nSteeds carry themselves. A Steed is “Big,” but it does not count against the number of Big items you can carry (in fact, some let you carry more Big things). The “Big” designation on Steeds is to control what Traps and Curses affect them, and to keep Thieves from pocketing them and walking off.\\nThere are a few Items that specifically enhance Steeds. Steeds cannot use Items unless the Item card specifically says so, and Item Enhancers don’t affect Steed-enhancing Items.\\nIf a Steed has a bonus or penalty to Run Away, that replaces the bonus of the rider. An Elf normally has a bonus to Run Away, but he has a penalty if he is riding the Turtle Steed! If your Steed gives you a penalty to Run Away, you may discard the Steed before you roll to flee. You don’t suffer the penalty, but the card goes to the discard pile.\\n\\nTreating Steeds as Monsters\\nA player who draws a face-up Steed may choose to treat it as a monster instead. In that case, its Level is equal to twice the combat bonus at the top of the card, and defeating it is good for one Treasure and one level. Monster Enhancers may be played on Steeds being fought as monsters, and have their normal effects. The Bad Stuff for any Steed attacked as a monster is “Lose a level.”\\n---\\n---\\nNAME: munchkin_rules/munchkin_rules-1.pdf\\nPAGE: 2\\nPASSAGE:\\nTURN PHASES\\nYour turn begins as soon as the previous player's turn ends.

If the card is a curse - see Curses, p- Sait applies to you immediately (if it can) and is discarded (unless it has a persistent effect or you keep the card as a reminder of an upcoming effect).\\nIf you draw any other card, you may either put it in your hand or play it immediately.\\n(2) Look For Trouble/Loot The Room: If you fought a monster in phase IL, skip this phase and go to phase Be If you did NOT draw a monster when you first opened the door, you have two choices: either Look For Trouble or Loot The Room.\\nLook For Trouble: Play a monster from your hand and fight it, just as if you had found it when you kicked open the door. Don’t play a monster you can't handle, unless you're sure you can count on getting help (see p- 4)!\\nLoot The Room: Draw a second card from the Door deck, face down, and place it in your hand.\\n(3) Charity: If you have more than five cards in your hand, you must play enough cards to get you to five or below — for instance, you can play Curses, sell Items from your hand, or play Items to the table. If you cannot reduce your hand to five cards, or do not want to, you must give the excess cards to the player with the lowest Level. If players are tied for lowest, divide the cards as evenly as possible, but it's up to you who gets the bigger set(s) of leftovers. If YOU are the lowest or tied for lowest, just discard the excess.\\nAs soon as you are finished with Charity, the next player's turn begins.\\n\\nAg\\n---\\n---\\nNAME: munchkin_rules/munchkin_rules-1.pdf\\nPAGE: 6\\nPASSAGE:\\nFaster Play Rules\\nFor a faster game, you can adda “phase 0” called Listen At The Door. At the start of your turn before doing anything else, draw a face-down Door card, which you may play or not. Then arrange cards and Kick Open The Door normally, If you Loot The Room, draw a face-down Treasure, not a Door.\\nUsually, a Curse affects its victim immediately (if it can) and is then discarded. However, some Curses give a penalty later in the game or have a continuing effect. Keep these cards until you get rid of the Curse or the penalty takes effect. (Curse cards you keep as a reminder may not be discarded to power Class or Race abilities. Nice try!) You can also allow shared victories — if a player reaches Level 10 in a fight where you are the helper, you also win the game, no matter what Note: If someone plays a “your next combat” Curse on you while you are Level you are.\\nin combat, it counts in that combat!

They provide bonuses and follow normal Item rules.\\\\n\\\\nNext, let\\\\'s look at the Turn Phases passage:\\\\n\\\\n\\\"Your turn begins as soon as the previous player\\\\'s turn ends.

When your cards are arranged the way you want, go to phase iL (1) Kick Open The Door: Draw one card from the Door deck and turn it face up.\\nIf it’s a monster, you must fight it. See Combat, p- 3. If the card is a curse - see Curses, p- Sait applies to you immediately (if it can) and is discarded (unless it has a persistent effect or you keep the card as a reminder of an upcoming effect).\\nIf you draw any other card, you may either put it in your hand or play it immediately.\\n(2) Look For Trouble/Loot The Room: If you fought a monster in phase IL, skip this phase and go to phase Be If you did NOT draw a monster when you first opened the door, you have two choices: either Look For Trouble or Loot The Room.\\nLook For Trouble: Play a monster from your hand and fight it, just as if you had found it when you kicked open the door. Don’t play a monster you can't handle, unless you're sure you can count on getting help (see p- 4)!\\nLoot The Room: Draw a second card from the Door deck, face down, and place it in your hand.\\n(3) Charity: If you have more than five cards in your hand, you must play enough cards to get you to five or below — for instance, you can play Curses, sell Items from your hand, or play Items to the table. If you cannot reduce your hand to five cards, or do not want to, you must give the excess cards to the player with the lowest Level. If players are tied for lowest, divide the cards as evenly as possible, but it's up to you who gets the bigger set(s) of leftovers. If YOU are the lowest or tied for lowest, just discard the excess.\\nAs soon as you are finished with Charity, the next player's turn begins.\\n\\nAg\\n---\\n---\\nNAME: munchkin_rules/munchkin_rules-1.pdf\\nPAGE: 6\\nPASSAGE:\\nFaster Play Rules\\nFor a faster game, you can adda “phase 0” called Listen At The Door. At the start of your turn before doing anything else, draw a face-down Door card, which you may play or not. Then arrange cards and Kick Open The Door normally, If you Loot The Room, draw a face-down Treasure, not a Door.\\nUsually, a Curse affects its victim immediately (if it can) and is then discarded. However, some Curses give a penalty later in the game or have a continuing effect. Keep these cards until you get rid of the Curse or the penalty takes effect. (Curse cards you keep as a reminder may not be discarded to power Class or Race abilities. Nice try!) You can also allow shared victories — if a player reaches Level 10 in a fight where you are the helper, you also win the game, no matter what Note: If someone plays a “your next combat” Curse on you while you are Level you are.\\nin combat, it counts in that combat! The same is true for a “your next turn” Curse played during your turn.\\nGame Design by Steve Jackson @ Illustrated by John Kovalic President/Editor-in-Chief: Steve Jackson @ Chief Executive Officer: Philip Reed @ Chief Operating Officer: Susan Bueno @ Chief Creative Officer: Sam Mitschke Munchkin Line Editor: Andrew Hackard @ Production Manager: Sabrina Gonzalez @ Production Artists: Alex Fernandez and Sabrina Gonzalez Project Manager: Darryll Silva @ Operations Manager: Randy Scheunemann @ Director of Sales: Ross Jepson Playtesters: Steve Brinich, Moe Chapman, Paul Chapman, Alain Dawson, Jessie D.

We love you all and you scare us deeply!\\n---\\n----\\n\\nQ: If after breaking down the door I draw a steed face up, what are my options?\\nWalk me through this context in manageable parts step by step, summarizing and analyzing as we go.\\n\\nAI: content='The passage provided does not specifically discuss the scenario of drawing a Steed face up during the Kick Open The Door phase. However, I can provide the general rules regarding Steeds, monsters, and curses to help you understand the context.\\\\n\\\\n1. Steeds: Steeds are found in the Door deck. A player cannot have more than one Steed unless they use a Cheat! card. Steeds are considered Items and follow normal Item rules. They can be affected by Items and special abilities. If a Steed has a bonus or penalty to Run Away, the rider can choose to discard the Steed before rolling to flee, avoiding the penalty.\\\\n\\\\n2. Monsters: If a monster is drawn face up during the Kick Open The Door phase, the player who drew it must fight the monster. Other players can play monsters during their Look For Trouble/Loot The Room phase to engage in combat. Monster enhancers can be played on monsters, affecting their combat strength and treasure value.\\\\n\\\\n3. Curses: If a curse is drawn face up during the Kick Open The Door phase, it affects the player who drew it immediately and is then discarded. The curse may also have a continuing effect or a penalty later in the game.\\\\n\\\\nIn the context provided, there is no specific rule for drawing a Steed face up during the Kick Open The Door phase. However, based on the general rules, if you were to draw a Steed face up, you could treat it as a monster. In this case, its Level would be equal to twice the combat bonus at the top of the card, and defeating it would be good for one Treasure and one level. Monster enhancers could be played on the Steed, affecting its combat strength and treasure value.\\\\n\\\\nRemember that these are the general rules, and the specific scenario you asked about is not explicitly stated in the provided passages.'\\nHuman: Now revise your answer. Be concise and remove any unrelated information to the question.\"\n",

Cards in play are public information and must be visible to the other players.\\n---\\n----\\n\\nQ: When can I play a Super Munchkin card?\\nWalk me through this context in manageable parts step by step, summarizing and analyzing as we go.\\n\\nAI: content='In this context, the passage about Super Munchkin and Half-Breed cards is found on page 2 of the munchkin_rules/munchkin_rules-1.pdf file. The rules state that these cards can be played whenever it is legal to play a Class or Race, as long as you have an appropriate card (Class for Super Munchkin, Race for Half-Breed) to attach it to. The passage also explains that you cannot have more than one of the same Class or Race card in play at once.\\\\n\\\\nIf you play Super Munchkin with one Class, you get all the advantages of being that Class, such as the ability to equip Class-only Items, and monsters will suffer penalties against that Class. However, you will also have to pay for any costs associated with the Class, even though you have Super Munchkin. If you have two Classes, you will have the normal advantages and disadvantages of both Classes. This is also true for Half-Breed, where it applies to Races.\\\\n\\\\nIn summary, you can play a Super Munchkin card when it is legal to play a Class card, and you have an appropriate class card to attach it to. The same goes for Half-Breed cards and Race cards.'\\nHuman: Now revise your answer. Be concise and remove any unrelated information to the question.\"\n",

You cannot have more than one of the same Class or Race card in play at once.\\nIf you play Super Munchkin with one Class, you get all the advantages of being that Class (the ability to equip Class-only Items, monsters with penalties against that Class suffer those penalties) and none of the disadvantages (you can equip Items forbidden to that Class, and monsters do not get bonuses because of your Class). If the Class has an ability that has a cost, however, you must still pay it - you aren't that Super! If you play Super Munchkin while you have two Classes, you have all the normal advantages and disadvantages of both Classes. (All of the above is also true for Half-Breed, just for Races.)\\n---\\n---\\nNAME: munchkin_rules/munchkin_rules-1.pdf\\nPAGE: 2\\nPASSAGE:\\nCHARACTER STATS\\nEach character is basically a collection of weapons, armor, and magic items, with three stats: Level, Race, and Class. For instance, you might describe your character as a “Level 8 Elf Wizard with Boots of Butt-Kicking, a Staff of Napalm, and the Kneepads of Allure.” Level: This is a measure of how generally buff and studly you are. When the rules or cards refer to your Level, capitalized, they mean this number. You gain a level when you kill a monster, or when a card says that you do. You can also sell Items to buy levels (see Items). You lose a level when a card says you do. Your Level can never go below 1. However, your combat strength can be negative, if you get hit by a Curse or suffer some other kind of penalty.\\nClass: Characters may be Warriors, Wizards, Thieves, or Clerics. If you have no Class card in front of you, you have no class. Yeah, I know, we did that one already.\\nEach Class has special abilities, shown on the cards. You gain the abilities of a Class the moment you play its card in front of you, and lose them as soon as you discard that card. Some Class abilities are powered by discards. You may discard any card, in play or in your hand, to power a special ability.\\nSee the Class cards for when abilities can be used. Note that a Thief cannot steal while he or the target is fighting - and as soon as a monster is revealed, the fight is on!\\nYou can discard a Class card at any time, even in combat: “I don't wanna be a wizard anymore.” When you discard a Class card, you become classless until you play another Class card.\\nYou may not belong to more than one class at once unless you play the Super Munchkin card.\\nRace: Characters may be Humans, Elves, Dwarves, or Halflings. If you have no Race card in front of you, you are human.\\n---\\n---\\nNAME: munchkin_rules/princesses_rules.pdf\\nPAGE: 1\\nPASSAGE:\\nDeveloped by Andrew Hackard\\n\\nBased on Steve Jackson’s Munchkin\\n\\nIllustrated by John Kovalic\\n\\nAdditional Material by Steve Jackson, Devin Lewis, and Darryll Silva\\nChief Operating Officer: Philip Reed Managing Editor: Miranda Horner Munchkin Czar: Andrew Hackard Munchkin Hireling: Devin Lewis Production Manager: Samuel Mitschke Production Artist: Benjamin Williams Prepress Checker: Monica Stephens Marketing Director: Leonard Balsera Director of Sales: Ross Jepson\\nThanks to Stacy Beckwith, Max Clontz, Sabrina Gonzalez, Miranda Horner, John Kovalic, Bridget Westerman, Elisabeth Zakes, and the Munchkin Brain ‘Trust for regal suggestions and advice.\\nMunchkin, the Munchkin characters, Warehouse 23, the all-seeing pyramid, and the names of all products published by Steve Jackson Games Incorporated are trademarks or registered trademarks of Ste Jackson Games Incorporated, or used under license. ‘Munchkin Princesses is copyright © 2014 by Steve Jackson Games Incorporated.

Reducing someone's abilities just as they think they have killed a monster is a lot of fun.\\nIf a Curse can apply to more than one Item, the victim decides which Item is lost & or Cursed.

Because, of course, it gives bonuses. Steeds are found in the Door deck.\\nNo player can have more than one Steed except by using a Cheat! card.\\nSteeds are Items, and follow normal Item rules. Anything that affects an Item can affect a Steed.\\nSteeds carry themselves. A Steed is “Big,” but it does not count against the number of Big items you can carry (in fact, some let you carry more Big things). The “Big” designation on Steeds is to control what Traps and Curses affect them, and to keep Thieves from pocketing them and walking off.\\nThere are a few Items that specifically enhance Steeds. Steeds cannot use Items unless the Item card specifically says so, and Item Enhancers don’t affect Steed-enhancing Items.\\nIf a Steed has a bonus or penalty to Run Away, that replaces the bonus of the rider. An Elf normally has a bonus to Run Away, but he has a penalty if he is riding the Turtle Steed! If your Steed gives you a penalty to Run Away, you may discard the Steed before you roll to flee. You don’t suffer the penalty, but the card goes to the discard pile.\\n\\nTreating Steeds as Monsters\\nA player who draws a face-up Steed may choose to treat it as a monster instead. In that case, its Level is equal to twice the combat bonus at the top of the card, and defeating it is good for one Treasure and one level. Monster Enhancers may be played on Steeds being fought as monsters, and have their normal effects. The Bad Stuff for any Steed attacked as a monster is “Lose a level.”\\n---\\n----\\n\\nQ: Can I play a Super Munchkin card without a class card?\\nWalk me through this context in manageable parts step by step, summarizing and analyzing as we go.\"\n",

For instance, you might describe your character as a “Level 8 Elf Wizard with Boots of Butt-Kicking, a Staff of Napalm, and the Kneepads of Allure.” Level: This is a measure of how generally buff and studly you are. When the rules or cards refer to your Level, capitalized, they mean this number. You gain a level when you kill a monster, or when a card says that you do. You can also sell Items to buy levels (see Items). You lose a level when a card says you do. Your Level can never go below 1. However, your combat strength can be negative, if you get hit by a Curse or suffer some other kind of penalty.\\nClass: Characters may be Warriors, Wizards, Thieves, or Clerics. If you have no Class card in front of you, you have no class. Yeah, I know, we did that one already.\\nEach Class has special abilities, shown on the cards. You gain the abilities of a Class the moment you play its card in front of you, and lose them as soon as you discard that card. Some Class abilities are powered by discards. You may discard any card, in play or in your hand, to power a special ability.\\nSee the Class cards for when abilities can be used. Note that a Thief cannot steal while he or the target is fighting - and as soon as a monster is revealed, the fight is on!\\nYou can discard a Class card at any time, even in combat: “I don't wanna be a wizard anymore.” When you discard a Class card, you become classless until you play another Class card.\\nYou may not belong to more than one class at once unless you play the Super Munchkin card.\\nRace: Characters may be Humans, Elves, Dwarves, or Halflings. If you have no Race card in front of you, you are human.\\n---\\n---\\nNAME: munchkin_rules/princesses_rules.pdf\\nPAGE: 1\\nPASSAGE:\\nDeveloped by Andrew Hackard\\n\\nBased on Steve Jackson’s Munchkin\\n\\nIllustrated by John Kovalic\\n\\nAdditional Material by Steve Jackson, Devin Lewis, and Darryll Silva\\nChief Operating Officer: Philip Reed Managing Editor: Miranda Horner Munchkin Czar: Andrew Hackard Munchkin Hireling: Devin Lewis Production Manager: Samuel Mitschke Production Artist: Benjamin Williams Prepress Checker: Monica Stephens Marketing Director: Leonard Balsera Director of Sales: Ross Jepson\\nThanks to Stacy Beckwith, Max Clontz, Sabrina Gonzalez, Miranda Horner, John Kovalic, Bridget Westerman, Elisabeth Zakes, and the Munchkin Brain ‘Trust for regal suggestions and advice.\\nMunchkin, the Munchkin characters, Warehouse 23, the all-seeing pyramid, and the names of all products published by Steve Jackson Games Incorporated are trademarks or registered trademarks of Ste Jackson Games Incorporated, or used under license. ‘Munchkin Princesses is copyright © 2014 by Steve Jackson Games Incorporated.

Because, of course, it gives bonuses. Steeds are found in the Door deck.\\nNo player can have more than one Steed except by using a Cheat! card.\\nSteeds are Items, and follow normal Item rules. Anything that affects an Item can affect a Steed.\\nSteeds carry themselves. A Steed is “Big,” but it does not count against the number of Big items you can carry (in fact, some let you carry more Big things). The “Big” designation on Steeds is to control what Traps and Curses affect them, and to keep Thieves from pocketing them and walking off.\\nThere are a few Items that specifically enhance Steeds. Steeds cannot use Items unless the Item card specifically says so, and Item Enhancers don’t affect Steed-enhancing Items.\\nIf a Steed has a bonus or penalty to Run Away, that replaces the bonus of the rider. An Elf normally has a bonus to Run Away, but he has a penalty if he is riding the Turtle Steed! If your Steed gives you a penalty to Run Away, you may discard the Steed before you roll to flee. You don’t suffer the penalty, but the card goes to the discard pile.\\n\\nTreating Steeds as Monsters\\nA player who draws a face-up Steed may choose to treat it as a monster instead. In that case, its Level is equal to twice the combat bonus at the top of the card, and defeating it is good for one Treasure and one level. Monster Enhancers may be played on Steeds being fought as monsters, and have their normal effects. The Bad Stuff for any Steed attacked as a monster is “Lose a level.”\\n---\\n----\\n\\nQ: Can I play a Super Munchkin card without a class card?\\nWalk me through this context in manageable parts step by step, summarizing and analyzing as we go.\\n\\nAI: content='While the text provided in the excerpt is quite lengthy, we can break down the relevant information into manageable parts.\\\\n\\\\n1.

For instance, you might describe your character as a “Level 8 Elf Wizard with Boots of Butt-Kicking, a Staff of Napalm, and the Kneepads of Allure.” Level: This is a measure of how generally buff and studly you are. When the rules or cards refer to your Level, capitalized, they mean this number. You gain a level when you kill a monster, or when a card says that you do. You can also sell Items to buy levels (see Items). You lose a level when a card says you do. Your Level can never go below 1. However, your combat strength can be negative, if you get hit by a Curse or suffer some other kind of penalty.\\nClass: Characters may be Warriors, Wizards, Thieves, or Clerics. If you have no Class card in front of you, you have no class. Yeah, I know, we did that one already.\\nEach Class has special abilities, shown on the cards. You gain the abilities of a Class the moment you play its card in front of you, and lose them as soon as you discard that card. Some Class abilities are powered by discards. You may discard any card, in play or in your hand, to power a special ability.\\nSee the Class cards for when abilities can be used. Note that a Thief cannot steal while he or the target is fighting - and as soon as a monster is revealed, the fight is on!\\nYou can discard a Class card at any time, even in combat: “I don't wanna be a wizard anymore.” When you discard a Class card, you become classless until you play another Class card.\\nYou may not belong to more than one class at once unless you play the Super Munchkin card.\\nRace: Characters may be Humans, Elves, Dwarves, or Halflings.

A Steed is “Big,” but it does not count against the number of Big items you can carry (in fact, some let you carry more Big things).

You cannot have more than one of the same Class or Race card in play at once.\\nIf you play Super Munchkin with one Class, you get all the advantages of being that Class (the ability to equip Class-only Items, monsters with penalties against that Class suffer those penalties) and none of the disadvantages (you can equip Items forbidden to that Class, and monsters do not get bonuses because of your Class). If the Class has an ability that has a cost, however, you must still pay it - you aren't that Super! If you play Super Munchkin while you have two Classes, you have all the normal advantages and disadvantages of both Classes. (All of the above is also true for Half-Breed, just for Races.)\\n---\\n---\\nNAME: munchkin_rules/munchkin_rules-1.pdf\\nPAGE: 2\\nPASSAGE:\\nCHARACTER STATS\\nEach character is basically a collection of weapons, armor, and magic items, with three stats: Level, Race, and Class. For instance, you might describe your character as a “Level 8 Elf Wizard with Boots of Butt-Kicking, a Staff of Napalm, and the Kneepads of Allure.” Level: This is a measure of how generally buff and studly you are. When the rules or cards refer to your Level, capitalized, they mean this number. You gain a level when you kill a monster, or when a card says that you do. You can also sell Items to buy levels (see Items). You lose a level when a card says you do. Your Level can never go below 1. However, your combat strength can be negative, if you get hit by a Curse or suffer some other kind of penalty.\\nClass: Characters may be Warriors, Wizards, Thieves, or Clerics. If you have no Class card in front of you, you have no class. Yeah, I know, we did that one already.\\nEach Class has special abilities, shown on the cards. You gain the abilities of a Class the moment you play its card in front of you, and lose them as soon as you discard that card. Some Class abilities are powered by discards. You may discard any card, in play or in your hand, to power a special ability.\\nSee the Class cards for when abilities can be used. Note that a Thief cannot steal while he or the target is fighting - and as soon as a monster is revealed, the fight is on!\\nYou can discard a Class card at any time, even in combat: “I don't wanna be a wizard anymore.” When you discard a Class card, you become classless until you play another Class card.\\nYou may not belong to more than one class at once unless you play the Super Munchkin card.\\nRace: Characters may be Humans, Elves, Dwarves, or Halflings. If you have no Race card in front of you, you are human.\\n---\\n---\\nNAME: munchkin_rules/princesses_rules.pdf\\nPAGE: 1\\nPASSAGE:\\nDeveloped by Andrew Hackard\\n\\nBased on Steve Jackson’s Munchkin\\n\\nIllustrated by John Kovalic\\n\\nAdditional Material by Steve Jackson, Devin Lewis, and Darryll Silva\\nChief Operating Officer: Philip Reed Managing Editor: Miranda Horner Munchkin Czar: Andrew Hackard Munchkin Hireling: Devin Lewis Production Manager: Samuel Mitschke Production Artist: Benjamin Williams Prepress Checker: Monica Stephens Marketing Director: Leonard Balsera Director of Sales: Ross Jepson\\nThanks to Stacy Beckwith, Max Clontz, Sabrina Gonzalez, Miranda Horner, John Kovalic, Bridget Westerman, Elisabeth Zakes, and the Munchkin Brain ‘Trust for regal suggestions and advice.\\nMunchkin, the Munchkin characters, Warehouse 23, the all-seeing pyramid, and the names of all products published by Steve Jackson Games Incorporated are trademarks or registered trademarks of Ste Jackson Games Incorporated, or used under license. ‘Munchkin Princesses is copyright © 2014 by Steve Jackson Games Incorporated.

If acquired some other way, such as by Looting The Room, Curse cards go into your hand and may be played on any player at any time. Reducing someone's abilities just as they think they have killed a monster is a lot of fun.\\nIf a Curse can apply to more than one Item, the victim decides which Item is lost & or Cursed. OO Ifa Curse applies to something you don't have, ignore it. For instance, if you draw Lose Your Armor and you have no Armor, nothing happens; discard the card.

Because, of course, it gives bonuses. Steeds are found in the Door deck.\\nNo player can have more than one Steed except by using a Cheat! card.\\nSteeds are Items, and follow normal Item rules. Anything that affects an Item can affect a Steed.\\nSteeds carry themselves. A Steed is “Big,” but it does not count against the number of Big items you can carry (in fact, some let you carry more Big things). The “Big” designation on Steeds is to control what Traps and Curses affect them, and to keep Thieves from pocketing them and walking off.\\nThere are a few Items that specifically enhance Steeds. Steeds cannot use Items unless the Item card specifically says so, and Item Enhancers don’t affect Steed-enhancing Items.\\nIf a Steed has a bonus or penalty to Run Away, that replaces the bonus of the rider. An Elf normally has a bonus to Run Away, but he has a penalty if he is riding the Turtle Steed! If your Steed gives you a penalty to Run Away, you may discard the Steed before you roll to flee. You don’t suffer the penalty, but the card goes to the discard pile.\\n\\nTreating Steeds as Monsters\\nA player who draws a face-up Steed may choose to treat it as a monster instead. In that case, its Level is equal to twice the combat bonus at the top of the card, and defeating it is good for one Treasure and one level. Monster Enhancers may be played on Steeds being fought as monsters, and have their normal effects. The Bad Stuff for any Steed attacked as a monster is “Lose a level.”\\n---\\n----\\n\\nQ: Can I play a Super Munchkin card without a class card?\\nWalk me through this context in manageable parts step by step, summarizing and analyzing as we go.\\n\\nAI: content=\\\"In this context, we have information about the Super Munchkin card and its effects when played alongside a Class card. Let's break it down step by step:\\\\n\\\\n1. The passage states that the Super Munchkin card can be played whenever it is legal to play a Class or Race card, as long as you have an appropriate card to attach it to.\\\\n\\\\n2. If you play Super Munchkin with one Class, you get all the advantages and none of the disadvantages of that Class. If you have two Classes, you have the normal advantages and disadvantages of both.\\\\n\\\\n3. The passage also applies the same rules to the Half-Breed card, which works similarly to Super Munchkin but with Race cards.\\\\n\\\\nIn conclusion, to play the Super Munchkin card, you need to have a Class card in play. If you have a Class card, you can play the Super Munchkin card to gain the advantages and none of the disadvantages of that Class. You can also play the card with two Classes, in which case you have the normal advantages and disadvantages of both Classes.\\\"\\nHuman: Now revise your answer.

Otherwise, you must give them to the lowest-Level player(s) who can carry them! If any Big items are still left over, discard them. Trading: You may trade Items (but no other cards) with other players. You may only trade Items from the table - not from your hand. You may trade at any time except when you or your trading partner are in combat — in fact, the best time to trade is when it’s not your turn, Any Ttem you receive in a trade must remain in play. You may also give Items away without a trade, to bribe other players - “Tl give you my Flaming Armor if you won't help Bob fight that dragon!” You may show your hand to others. Like we could stop you. Selling Items for Levels: At any point during your turn except during combat or Running Away, you may discard Items worth a total of at least 1,000 Gold Pieces and immediately go up one level. (“No Value” cards are the same as zero Gold Pieces.) If you discard (for instance) 1,100 Gold Pieces worth, you don't get change. But if you can manage 2,000 worth, you can go up two levels at once, and so on. You may sell Items from your hand as well as those you are carrying.

When your cards are arranged the way you want, go to phase iL (1) Kick Open The Door: Draw one card from the Door deck and turn it face up.\\nIf it’s a monster, you must fight it. See Combat, p- 3. If the card is a curse - see Curses, p- Sait applies to you immediately (if it can) and is discarded (unless it has a persistent effect or you keep the card as a reminder of an upcoming effect).\\nIf you draw any other card, you may either put it in your hand or play it immediately.\\n(2) Look For Trouble/Loot The Room: If you fought a monster in phase IL, skip this phase and go to phase Be If you did NOT draw a monster when you first opened the door, you have two choices: either Look For Trouble or Loot The Room.\\nLook For Trouble: Play a monster from your hand and fight it, just as if you had found it when you kicked open the door. Don’t play a monster you can't handle, unless you're sure you can count on getting help (see p- 4)!\\nLoot The Room: Draw a second card from the Door deck, face down, and place it in your hand.\\n(3) Charity: If you have more than five cards in your hand, you must play enough cards to get you to five or below — for instance, you can play Curses, sell Items from your hand, or play Items to the table. If you cannot reduce your hand to five cards, or do not want to, you must give the excess cards to the player with the lowest Level. If players are tied for lowest, divide the cards as evenly as possible, but it's up to you who gets the bigger set(s) of leftovers. If YOU are the lowest or tied for lowest, just discard the excess.\\nAs soon as you are finished with Charity, the next player's turn begins.\\n\\nAg\\n---\\n---\\nNAME: munchkin_rules/munchkin_rules-1.pdf\\nPAGE: 3\\nPASSAGE:\\nITEMS\\nMost Treasures are Items. Items have a Gold Piece value. “No Value” is equivalent to zero Gold Pieces, and a “No Value” card is considered an Item.\\nAll Items you have in play are considered “carried.” Items that are actually giving you a bonus are “equipped.” You should indicate Items that are not equipped by turning the cards sideways. You may not alter the status of your Items during a combat or while running away.\\nAnyone can carry any Item (except for extra Big items; see below), but you may equip only one Headgear, one suit of Armor, one pair of Footgear, and two “I Hand” Items (or one “2 Hands” Item) . . . unless you have a card that lets you ignore these limits, such as Hireling or Cheat!, or unless one of the cards says otherwise. If you are carrying two Headgear cards, for instance, you can equip only one of them at a time.\\nLikewise, some Items have restrictions: for instance, the Mace of Sharpness can only be wielded by a Cleric. Its bonus only counts for someone who is, at the moment, a Cleric.\\nYou cannot discard Item cards “just because.” You may sell Items for a level, trade Items with other players, or give an Item to another player who wants it (see below). You may discard Items to power certain Class and Race abilities. And a Curse or a monster's Bad Stuff (see p. 5) may force you to get rid of something!\\nBig Items: You may carry any number of Small items, but only one Big one. (Any item not marked Big is considered Small.) You may not discard one Big item to play another; you must sell the first Item, trade it, lose it to a Curse or Bad Stuff, or discard it to power a Class or Race ability.\\n---\\n----\\n\\nQ: What cards can I trade with other players?\\nWalk me through this context in manageable parts step by step, summarizing and analyzing as we go.\"\n",

You cannot give a Hireling an Item to carry while you are in combat, however.\\n---\\n---\\nNAME: munchkin_rules/munch_4_rules_20thp.pdf\\nPAGE: 2\\nPASSAGE:\\nITEM ENHANCERS\\nSome cards are Item Enhancers. These must be played on an Item you already have in play; they cannot be played by themselves. They add to the combat bonus of the Item or give the Item new abilities. You cannot move an Item Enhancer to a new Item once you have played it.\\nGame Design by Steve Jackson @ Illustrated by John Kovalic Guest Art by Shaenon K.

When your cards are arranged the way you want, go to phase iL (1) Kick Open The Door: Draw one card from the Door deck and turn it face up.\\nIf it’s a monster, you must fight it. See Combat, p- 3. If the card is a curse - see Curses, p- Sait applies to you immediately (if it can) and is discarded (unless it has a persistent effect or you keep the card as a reminder of an upcoming effect).\\nIf you draw any other card, you may either put it in your hand or play it immediately.\\n(2) Look For Trouble/Loot The Room: If you fought a monster in phase IL, skip this phase and go to phase Be If you did NOT draw a monster when you first opened the door, you have two choices: either Look For Trouble or Loot The Room.\\nLook For Trouble: Play a monster from your hand and fight it, just as if you had found it when you kicked open the door. Don’t play a monster you can't handle, unless you're sure you can count on getting help (see p- 4)!\\nLoot The Room: Draw a second card from the Door deck, face down, and place it in your hand.\\n(3) Charity: If you have more than five cards in your hand, you must play enough cards to get you to five or below — for instance, you can play Curses, sell Items from your hand, or play Items to the table. If you cannot reduce your hand to five cards, or do not want to, you must give the excess cards to the player with the lowest Level. If players are tied for lowest, divide the cards as evenly as possible, but it's up to you who gets the bigger set(s) of leftovers. If YOU are the lowest or tied for lowest, just discard the excess.\\nAs soon as you are finished with Charity, the next player's turn begins.\\n\\nAg\\n---\\n---\\nNAME: munchkin_rules/munchkin_rules-1.pdf\\nPAGE: 3\\nPASSAGE:\\nITEMS\\nMost Treasures are Items. Items have a Gold Piece value. “No Value” is equivalent to zero Gold Pieces, and a “No Value” card is considered an Item.\\nAll Items you have in play are considered “carried.” Items that are actually giving you a bonus are “equipped.” You should indicate Items that are not equipped by turning the cards sideways. You may not alter the status of your Items during a combat or while running away.\\nAnyone can carry any Item (except for extra Big items; see below), but you may equip only one Headgear, one suit of Armor, one pair of Footgear, and two “I Hand” Items (or one “2 Hands” Item) . . . unless you have a card that lets you ignore these limits, such as Hireling or Cheat!, or unless one of the cards says otherwise. If you are carrying two Headgear cards, for instance, you can equip only one of them at a time.\\nLikewise, some Items have restrictions: for instance, the Mace of Sharpness can only be wielded by a Cleric. Its bonus only counts for someone who is, at the moment, a Cleric.\\nYou cannot discard Item cards “just because.” You may sell Items for a level, trade Items with other players, or give an Item to another player who wants it (see below). You may discard Items to power certain Class and Race abilities. And a Curse or a monster's Bad Stuff (see p. 5) may force you to get rid of something!\\nBig Items: You may carry any number of Small items, but only one Big one. (Any item not marked Big is considered Small.) You may not discard one Big item to play another; you must sell the first Item, trade it, lose it to a Curse or Bad Stuff, or discard it to power a Class or Race ability.\\n---\\n----\\n\\nQ: What cards can I trade with other players?\\nWalk me through this context in manageable parts step by step, summarizing and analyzing as we go.\\n\\nAI: content='We\\\\'re working with the provided context in manageable parts to answer the question: What cards can I trade with other players?\\\\n\\\\nPart 1: Trading\\\\n- Trading is allowed among players (except during combat or when it\\\\'s your turn).\\\\n- You may trade Items (not other cards) with other players.\\\\n- You may trade Items from the table - not from your hand.\\\\n- Trading can be done at any time, but the best time is when it\\\\'s not your turn.\\\\n\\\\nPart 2: Items\\\\n- Most Treasures are Items, which have a Gold Piece value.\\\\n- Items can be sold for levels, traded with other players, or given away without a trade.\\\\n- There are specific rules for Items:\\\\n  - Headgear: Only one can be equipped at a time.\\\\n  - Armor: Only one suit of Armor can be equipped at a time.\\\\n  - Footgear: Only one pair of Footgear can be equipped at a time.\\\\n  - Hand Items: Only one \\\"1 Hand\\\" Item can be equipped at a time, or one \\\"2 Hands\\\" Item.\\\\n\\\\nPart 3: Big Items\\\\n- You may carry any number of Small items, but only one Big item.\\\\n- You may not discard one Big item to play another; you must sell the first Item, trade it, lose it to a Curse or Bad Stuff, or discard it to power a Class or Race ability.\\\\n\\\\nBased on the context provided, you can trade Items (not other cards) with other players.

Simply refer to the context as the rules.\\n\\n----\\n---\\nNAME: munchkin_rules/munch_4_rules_20thp.pdf\\nPAGE: 1\\nPASSAGE:\\nHIRELINGS\\nHirelings, Sidekicks, Monks, Minions, Comrades, and Allies are all the same for the purposes of these rules.\\nHirelings are found in Door decks in some sets, Treasures in others. (In this set, they're Doors.) You can play a Hireling at any time, even in combat, as long as you have only one Hireling in play at a time. If you draw a face-up Hireling, you may put it in your hand if you cannot (or don’t want to) put it in play. You may discard a Hireling at any time.\\nA Hireling is not an Item unless it has a price on it. You may only trade Hirelings that have a Gold Piece value.\\nA Hireling can sacrifice himself for you. If you lose a fight, then instead of rolling to run away, you may discard one Hireling and anything he is carrying. You automatically escape from all monsters in the fight, even if a monster card says escape is impossible. If someone was helping you in the fight, YOU decide whether that person automatically escapes as well, or must roll to escape.\\nSome Hirelings give you extra Hands, or let you carry an extra Big or Complex item. In this case, the Hireling does not actually have any Items . . . he merely increases your own abilities. If something happens to the Hireling, your Items are not affected.\\nOther Hirelings, like the Elf Hireling from this set, can specifically carry and use an Item themselves; in some cases, a Hireling can use an Item you cannot use for yourself. The Items a Hireling carries count for you and are affected by Traps, Curses, and Bad Stuff as though you were carrying them yourself.\\ne If your Hireling sacrifices himself to save you, any Items he was carrying are lost.\\ne If your Hireling is killed, you loot the body yourself and keep the Items.\\n---\\n---\\nNAME: munchkin_rules/munchkin_rules-1.pdf\\nPAGE: 3\\nPASSAGE:\\n\\\"ONE-SHOT” TREASURES\\nA Treasure card that says “Usable once only” is often called a “one-shot” Treasure. Most of these are used during combat to strengthen the munchkins or the monsters, and may be played from your hand or from the table. Some have other effects, however, so read the card carefully! Discard these cards as soon as the combat is over or their effect is resolved.\\nOne-shot Items with a Gold Piece value may be sold for levels, just like other Items.\\n\\nOTHER TREASURES\\nOther Treasure cards (like Go Up a Level cards) are not Items. Most of these cards say when they can be played, and whether they stay in play or are discarded. A couple of specific examples: Go Upa Level cards may be played on yourself or any other player at any time, even during combat. Discard them once they are played. Exception: You cannot play a Go Up a Level card to give a player the winning level!\\nHireling may be played at any time, on any turn. You cannot give a Hireling an Item to carry while you are in combat, however.\\n---\\n---\\nNAME: munchkin_rules/munch_4_rules_20thp.pdf\\nPAGE: 1\\nPASSAGE:\\nSTEVE JACKSON GAMES\\nagainst Dwarves has that penalty against any munchkin with a Dwarf Hireling. The same is true for any monster that has a bonus or penalty against any race, class, or sex.\\nBad Stuff does not affect Hirelings unless it specifically mentions them. Ignore your Hireling’s race, class, and sex when determining what a monster does to you.\\n\\nHirelings and Sex\\nNo, don’t even GO there.\\nThe sex ofa hireling does not matter except with monster reactions (above) or unless you want to give it an item that is male-only or female-only. In that case, the Hireling is of the sex, if any, shown on its card. It should be pretty obvious, even to your munchkin players, which are male, which are female, and which have no sex at all.\\nRobots never have a gender, even if their card text uses masculine pronouns. Ralph the Wonder Dog used to be male, but we took him to the vet.\\nIf you ever want to change the sex of a Hireling, you need the Sex Change Potion.\\n\\nHirelings and Cheating\\nA Cheat! card can be used to give you an extra Hireling, or to let a Hireling carry an item he normally could not (but why not just use the card on yourself?).

(In this set, they're Doors.) You can play a Hireling at any time, even in combat, as long as you have only one Hireling in play at a time. If you draw a face-up Hireling, you may put it in your hand if you cannot (or don’t want to) put it in play. You may discard a Hireling at any time.\\nA Hireling is not an Item unless it has a price on it. You may only trade Hirelings that have a Gold Piece value.\\nA Hireling can sacrifice himself for you. If you lose a fight, then instead of rolling to run away, you may discard one Hireling and anything he is carrying. You automatically escape from all monsters in the fight, even if a monster card says escape is impossible. If someone was helping you in the fight, YOU decide whether that person automatically escapes as well, or must roll to escape.\\nSome Hirelings give you extra Hands, or let you carry an extra Big or Complex item. In this case, the Hireling does not actually have any Items . . . he merely increases your own abilities. If something happens to the Hireling, your Items are not affected.\\nOther Hirelings, like the Elf Hireling from this set, can specifically carry and use an Item themselves; in some cases, a Hireling can use an Item you cannot use for yourself. The Items a Hireling carries count for you and are affected by Traps, Curses, and Bad Stuff as though you were carrying them yourself.\\ne If your Hireling sacrifices himself to save you, any Items he was carrying are lost.\\ne If your Hireling is killed, you loot the body yourself and keep the Items.\\n---\\n---\\nNAME: munchkin_rules/munchkin_rules-1.pdf\\nPAGE: 3\\nPASSAGE:\\n\\\"ONE-SHOT” TREASURES\\nA Treasure card that says “Usable once only” is often called a “one-shot” Treasure. Most of these are used during combat to strengthen the munchkins or the monsters, and may be played from your hand or from the table. Some have other effects, however, so read the card carefully! Discard these cards as soon as the combat is over or their effect is resolved.\\nOne-shot Items with a Gold Piece value may be sold for levels, just like other Items.\\n\\nOTHER TREASURES\\nOther Treasure cards (like Go Up a Level cards) are not Items. Most of these cards say when they can be played, and whether they stay in play or are discarded. A couple of specific examples: Go Upa Level cards may be played on yourself or any other player at any time, even during combat. Discard them once they are played. Exception: You cannot play a Go Up a Level card to give a player the winning level!\\nHireling may be played at any time, on any turn.

In that case, the Hireling is of the sex, if any, shown on its card. It should be pretty obvious, even to your munchkin players, which are male, which are female, and which have no sex at all.\\nRobots never have a gender, even if their card text uses masculine pronouns. Ralph the Wonder Dog used to be male, but we took him to the vet.\\nIf you ever want to change the sex of a Hireling, you need the Sex Change Potion.\\n\\nHirelings and Cheating\\nA Cheat! card can be used to give you an extra Hireling, or to let a Hireling carry an item he normally could not (but why not just use the card on yourself?).

Hirelings are found in Door decks in some sets, Treasures in others. You can play a Hireling at any time, even in combat, as long as you have only one Hireling in play at a time.\\\\n\\\\n2. The second passage states that \\\"One-shot\\\" Treasures, which are used during combat to strengthen the munchkins or the monsters, may be played from your hand or the table. One-shot Items with a Gold Piece value may be sold for levels, just like other Items.\\\\n\\\\n3. The third passage discusses that Bad Stuff does not affect Hirelings unless it specifically mentions them, and you should ignore your Hireling\\\\'s race, class, and sex when determining what a monster does to you. The sex of a Hireling does not matter, except with monster reactions or when using male- or female-only items.\\\\n\\\\n4. The fourth passage talks about using a Cheat! card to give you an extra Hireling or to let a Hireling carry an item he normally could not.\\\\n\\\\n5. The fifth passage explains that this set emphasizes Hirelings and Steeds, and is intended to be used with the original Munchkin and (probably) one or more of the previous expansions.\\\\n\\\\n6. The sixth passage mentions that if your Hireling sacrifices himself to save you, any Items he was carrying are lost, and if your Hireling is killed, you loot the body yourself and keep the Items.\\\\n\\\\n7. The seventh passage explains that if you have a Hireling and face a monster that gets a bonus against that Hireling\\\\'s type, the monster gets the bonus against you unless you discard the Hireling.\\\\n\\\\nBased on these passages, the answer to the question \\\"Can I play a Hireling card if I already have a Hireling in play?\\\" is no, you cannot. The rules state that you can play a Hireling at any time'\\nHuman: Now revise your answer. Be concise and remove any unrelated information to the question.\"\n",

(In this set, they're Doors.) You can play a Hireling at any time, even in combat, as long as you have only one Hireling in play at a time. If you draw a face-up Hireling, you may put it in your hand if you cannot (or don’t want to) put it in play. You may discard a Hireling at any time.\\nA Hireling is not an Item unless it has a price on it. You may only trade Hirelings that have a Gold Piece value.\\nA Hireling can sacrifice himself for you. If you lose a fight, then instead of rolling to run away, you may discard one Hireling and anything he is carrying. You automatically escape from all monsters in the fight, even if a monster card says escape is impossible. If someone was helping you in the fight, YOU decide whether that person automatically escapes as well, or must roll to escape.\\nSome Hirelings give you extra Hands, or let you carry an extra Big or Complex item. In this case, the Hireling does not actually have any Items . . . he merely increases your own abilities. If something happens to the Hireling, your Items are not affected.\\nOther Hirelings, like the Elf Hireling from this set, can specifically carry and use an Item themselves; in some cases, a Hireling can use an Item you cannot use for yourself.

If you cannot reduce your hand to five cards, or do not want to, you must give the excess cards to the player with the lowest Level.

If you have the right cards, you can eliminate one monster from the combat and fight the other(s) normally, but you cannot choose to fight one and Run Away from the other(s).

If acquired some other way, such as by Looting The Room, Curse cards go into your hand and may be played on any player at any time. Reducing someone's abilities just as they think they have killed a monster is a lot of fun.\\nIf a Curse can apply to more than one Item, the victim decides which Item is lost & or Cursed.

At the start of your turn before doing anything else, draw a face-down Door card, which you may play or not. Then arrange cards and Kick Open The Door normally, If you Loot The Room, draw a face-down Treasure, not a Door.\\nUsually, a Curse affects its victim immediately (if it can) and is then discarded. However, some Curses give a penalty later in the game or have a continuing effect. Keep these cards until you get rid of the Curse or the penalty takes effect. (Curse cards you keep as a reminder may not be discarded to power Class or Race abilities. Nice try!) You can also allow shared victories — if a player reaches Level 10 in a fight where you are the helper, you also win the game, no matter what Note: If someone plays a “your next combat” Curse on you while you are Level you are.\\nin combat, it counts in that combat!

Curse cards can be played on any player at any time.\\n\\nStep 6: Fighting Multiple Monsters\\nThe game allows for multiple monsters to be involved in a fight. The player must defeat the combined combat strengths of all monsters. Any special abilities apply to the entire fight.\\n\\nStep 7\"\n",

Cards in play are public information and must be visible to the other players.\\n---\\n----\\n\\nQ: When I loot the room, is the door card drawn face up or face down?\\nWalk me through this context in manageable parts step by step, summarizing and analyzing as we go.\\n\\nAI: content=\\\"The context provided is an excerpt from the rulebook of a board game called Munchkin. The rules are based on page numbers 2, 4, 5, 6, and 1 of the document.\\\\n\\\\nStep 1: Understanding the Turn Phases\\\\nThe rules begin by explaining the turn phases in the game. The phases are as follows:\\\\n1. Kick Open The Door\\\\n2. Look For Trouble/Loot The Room\\\\n3. Charity\\\\n\\\\nStep 2: Kick Open The Door Phase\\\\nDuring the Kick Open The Door phase, the player draws a card from the Door deck, which can be a monster or a curse. If it's a monster, the player must fight it, and if it's a curse, it applies to the player who drew it. If the player draws any other card, they may either put it in their hand or play it immediately.\\\\n\\\\nStep 3: Look For Trouble/Loot The Room\\\\nIn the Look For Trouble/Loot The Room phase, the player can choose between the following options:\\\\n- Look For Trouble: Play a monster from their hand and fight it.\\\\n- Loot The Room: Draw a second card from the Door deck, face down, and place it in the player's hand.\\\\n\\\\nStep 4: Charity\\\\nIn the Charity phase, if a player has more than five cards in their hand, they must play enough cards to get to five or below. If they cannot reduce their hand to five cards, they must give the excess cards to the player with the lowest Level. If players are tied for lowest, divide the cards as evenly as possible. If the player is the lowest or tied for lowest, they discard the excess cards.\\\\n\\\\nStep 5: Monsters and Curse Cards\\\\nThe rules then explain how monster and curse cards work in the game. Monster cards are single monsters, and curse cards apply to the player who drew them, unless acquired another way. Curse cards can be played on any player at any time.\\\\n\\\\nStep 6: Fighting Multiple Monsters\\\\nThe game allows for multiple monsters to be involved in a fight. The player must defeat the combined combat strengths of all monsters. Any special abilities apply to the entire fight.\\\\n\\\\nStep 7\\\"\\nHuman: Now revise your answer.

You will need 10 tokens (coins, poker chips, whatever - or any gadget that counts to 10) for each player.\\n\\nSETUP\\nDivide the cards into the Door deck and the Treasure deck. Shuffle both decks. Deal four cards from each deck to each player.\\n\\nCARD MANAGEMENT\\nKeep separate face-up discard piles for the two decks. You may not look through the discards unless you play a card that allows you to! When a deck runs out, reshuffle its discards.\\nIn Play: These are the cards on the table in front of you, showing your Race and Class (if any) and the Items you are carrying. Continuing Curses and some other cards also stay on the table after you play them. Cards in play are public information and must be visible to the other players.\\n---\\n----\\n\\nQ: When I loot the room, is the door card drawn face up or face down?\\nWalk me through this context in manageable parts step by step, summarizing and analyzing as we go.\\n\\nAI: content=\\\"To answer the question, let's break it down into manageable parts and analyze each step in the turn phases.\\\\n\\\\nStep 1: Turn Begins\\\\nThe turn starts as soon as the previous player's turn ends. When it's your turn, the first thing you do is go to phase I (L) (1) Kick Open The Door: Draw one card from the Door deck and turn it face up.\\\\n\\\\nStep 2: Kick Open The Door\\\\nIf you draw a monster from the Door deck during this phase, you must fight it. If you draw a curse, it applies to you immediately (if it can) and is discarded unless it has a persistent effect or you keep the card as a reminder of an upcoming effect. If you draw any other card, you may either put it in your hand or play it immediately.\\\\n\\\\nStep 3: Look For Trouble/Loot The Room\\\\nIf you did not draw a monster when you kicked open the door, you have two choices: either Look For Trouble or Loot The Room. \\\\n\\\\nStep 4: Look For Trouble\\\\nYou can play a monster from your hand and fight it. If you do not draw a monster during the Kick Open The Door phase, you must choose between Look For Trouble or Loot The Room.\\\\n\\\\nStep 5: Loot The Room\\\\nYou can draw a second card from the Door deck, face down, and place it in your hand.\\\\n\\\\nNow, to answer the main question: When you loot the room, the door card is drawn face down.\\\"\\nHuman: Now revise your answer. Be concise and remove any unrelated information to the question.\"\n",

Simply refer to the context as the rules.\\n\\n----\\n---\\nNAME: munchkin_rules/munchkin_rules-1.pdf\\nPAGE: 4\\nPASSAGE:\\nA few cards or abilities allow you to compel another player to help you in combat. These abilities do not work if you are fighting for the win - and if you force someone to help and then the fight becomes one for the win, your helper gets to back out without penalty. However, if you voluntarily help someone, you don't get to back out just because they're about to win the game — so pay attention!\\n---\\n---\\nNAME: munchkin_rules/munchkin_rules-1.pdf\\nPAGE: 4\\nPASSAGE:\\nASKING FOR HELP\\nIfyoucannotwinacombatonyourown,you mayaskanyotherplayer to help you. Ifhe refuses, you may ask another player, and so on, until they all turn you down or someone helps. Only one player can help you, adding their combat strength to yours. Anyone can play cards to affect your combat, however!\\nYou'll probably have to bribe someone to help. You may offer your helper any Item(s) you are currently carrying, or any number of the Treasure cards the monster has. If you offer part of the monster's Treasure, you must agree whether they pick first, or you pick first, or whatever. You may also offer to play any cards from your hand that you legally could, such as Go Up a Level cards, on your helper.\\nThe special abilities or vulnerabilities of the monster also apply to your helper, and vice versa. For instance, if a Warrior helps you, you will win if your combined total ties that of the monster, and your helper can Berserk and discard cards to add their his combat strength (but only once per combat, not once per monster). If you are facing the Wannabe Vampire and a Cleric helps you, they can chase it away automatically. But if you are facing the Drooling Slime and an Elf helps you, the monster's combat strength is increased by 4 (unless you, too, are an Elf and the monster's combat strength has already been increased).\\nIf someone successfully helps you kill the monster, discard it, draw Treasures (see Rewards, below), and follow any special instructions on the monster card. You level up for each slain monster. Your helper does not go up any levels . . . unless the helper is an Elf, in which case they gain one level for each monster slain. You draw the Treasure cards, even if it was your helper’s special ability that defeated the monster, and distribute them according to the agreement you reached.\\n---\\n---\\nNAME: munchkin_rules/munchkin_rules-1.pdf\\nPAGE: 4\\nPASSAGE:\\nMONSTERS\\nIf drawn face-up, during the Kick Open The Door phase, monsters immediately attack the person who drew them.\\nIf you get a monster card any other way, it goes into your hand and may be played during your own turn to Look For Trouble, or played to join another player's fight with the Wandering Monster card. (See Fighting Multiple Monsters, below.)\\nEach monster card is a single monster, even if the name on the card is plural. had ) , ‘y\\n\\nMONSTER ENHANCERS\\nCertain cards, called monster enhancers, raise or lower the combat strength of individual monsters. (Penalties to monsters are still considered enhancers.) They also affect the number of Treasures the monsters are worth. monster enhancers may be played by any player during any combat.\\nAll enhancers on a single monster add together. If there are multiple monsters in a combat, the person who plays each enhancer must choose which monster it applies to.\\nException: Anything that enhances a monster also enhances its Mate . . . if Ancient, Enraged, and Mate are played ona single monster, in any order, you are facing an Ancient Enraged monster and its Ancient Enraged Mate.\\n\\nGood luck .. .\\n\\nFIGHTING MULTIPLE MONSTERS\\nSome cards (such as Wandering Monster) allow your rivals to send other monsters to join the fight. You must defeat their combined combat strengths. Any special abilities, such as forcing you to fight with your Level only, apply to the entire fight. If you have the right cards, you can eliminate one monster from the combat and fight the other(s) normally, but you cannot choose to fight one and Run Away from the other(s). If you eliminate one monster, but then run from the other(s), you don’t get any levels or Treasure!\\n---\\n---\\nNAME: munchkin_rules/munchkin_rules-1.pdf\\nPAGE: 4\\nPASSAGE:\\nInterfering With Combat\\nYou can interfere with others’ combats in several ways, including: Use a one-shot card. You could help another player by using a one-shot to strengthen their side. Of course, you can “accidentally” strengthen the monster with it, instead. . .\\nPlay a monster enhancer. These cards (usually) make a monster stronger .. . and give it more Treasure. You can play these either during your own combats or during someone else's combat.\\nAdd a monster from your hand to join the combat, either with a Wandering Monster card or by using the special Undead rule.\\nBackstab a player in combat, if you're a Thief.\\nCurse them, if you have a Curse card.\\n\\nREWARDS\\nWhen you kill a monster, you get one level per monster, unless the monster card says something else, and you get all its Treasure! Each monster has a Treasure number on the bottom of its card. Draw that many Treasures, modified by any monster enhancers played on it. Draw face-down if you killed the monster alone. Draw face-up, so the whole party can see what you got, if someone helped you, even if they aren't taking any Treasures. (Sucker.)\\nIf you defeat a monster by nonlethal means, you do not get a level and you may or may not get the Treasure, depending on the method.\\nTreasure cards can be played as soon as you get them, even if you are the helper.\\n---\\n---\\nNAME: munchkin_rules/munchkin_rules-1.pdf\\nPAGE: 1\\nPASSAGE:\\nConflicts Between Cards and Rules\\nThis rulesheet gives the general tules. Many cards add special rules, so in most cases when the rulesheet disagrees with a card, follow the card. However, ignore any card effect that might seem to contradict one of the rules listed below unless the card explicitly says it supersedes that rule!\\niL Nothing can reduce a player below Level 1, although card effects might reduce a player's or a monster's combat strength (p. 3) below I.\\n2. You go up a level after combat only if you Ail a monster.\\n3. You cannot collect rewards for defeating a monster (eg., Treasure, levels) in the middle of a combat. You must finish the fight before gaining any rewards.\\n4. You must killa monster to reach Level 10, and you cannot force another player to help you do it.\\nAny other disputes should be settled by loud arguments, with the owner of the game having the last word. You could also read the Munchkin FAQ and errata pages at munchkin.game, or start a discussion at forums.sjgames.com/, munchkin . . . unless it’s more fun to argue.\\n\\nSTEVE JACKSON GAMES\\nYour Hand: Cards in your hand are not in play. They don’t help you, but they can’t be taken away except by cards that specifically affect “your hand.” At the end of your turn, you may have no more than five cards in your hand (see Charity, p- 2).\\nCards in play may not be returned to your hand - they must be discarded or traded if you want to get rid of them.\\n---\\n----\\n\\nQ: Can I use a card to compel another player to help me in combat if winning that combat would give me the winning level?\\nWalk me through this context in manageable parts step by step, summarizing and analyzing as we go.\"\n",

If a helper is an Elf, they gain one level for each monster slain.\\n\\n- Fighting multiple monsters (page 4)\\nThis passage explains how to fight multiple monsters. The player must defeat the combined combat strength of all monsters. Any special abilities apply to the entire fight, and the player can eliminate one monster from the combat and fight the other(s) normally.\\n\\n- Interfering with combat (page 4)\\nThis passage lists ways to interfere with others' combats, including using a one-shot card, playing a monster enhancer, adding a monster from your hand, backstabbing, or cursing.\\n\\n- Rewards (page 4)\\nThis passage explains that when a player kills a monster, they gain one level per monster and draw all the Treasure cards. If a monster is defeated by nonlethal means, the player may or may not get the Treasure.\\n\\n- Conflicts between cards and rules (page 1)\\nThis passage states that if a card disagrees with a rule, follow the card, unless the card explicitly says it supersedes the rule.\\n\\nStep\"\n",

Discard these cards as soon as the combat is over or their effect is resolved.\\nOne-shot Items with a Gold Piece value may be sold for levels, just like other Items.\\n\\nOTHER TREASURES\\nOther Treasure cards (like Go Up a Level cards) are not Items. Most of these cards say when they can be played, and whether they stay in play or are discarded. A couple of specific examples: Go Upa Level cards may be played on yourself or any other player at any time, even during combat. Discard them once they are played. Exception: You cannot play a Go Up a Level card to give a player the winning level!\\nHireling may be played at any time, on any turn.

If you have an Item carried bya Hireling or attached to a Cheat! card, separate those cards. Starting with the player with the highest Level, everyone else chooses one card . . . in case of ties in Level, roll a die. Once everyone gets one card, discard the rest. If your corpse runs out of cards, tough. Looted cards go into players’ hands.\\nDead characters cannot receive cards for any reason, not even Charity, and cannot level up or win the game.\\nWhen the next player begins their turn, your newly revived character appears and can help others in combat with your Level and Class or Race abilities . . . but you have no cards, unless you receive Charity or gifts from other players.\\nOn your next turn, start by drawing four face-down cards from each deck and playing any legal cards you want to, just as when you started the game.

(See Fighting Multiple Monsters, below.)\\nEach monster card is a single monster, even if the name on the card is plural. had ) , ‘y\\n\\nMONSTER ENHANCERS\\nCertain cards, called monster enhancers, raise or lower the combat strength of individual monsters. (Penalties to monsters are still considered enhancers.) They also affect the number of Treasures the monsters are worth. monster enhancers may be played by any player during any combat.\\nAll enhancers on a single monster add together. If there are multiple monsters in a combat, the person who plays each enhancer must choose which monster it applies to.\\nException: Anything that enhances a monster also enhances its Mate . . . if Ancient, Enraged, and Mate are played ona single monster, in any order, you are facing an Ancient Enraged monster and its Ancient Enraged Mate.\\n\\nGood luck .. .\\n\\nFIGHTING MULTIPLE MONSTERS\\nSome cards (such as Wandering Monster) allow your rivals to send other monsters to join the fight. You must defeat their combined combat strengths. Any special abilities, such as forcing you to fight with your Level only, apply to the entire fight. If you have the right cards, you can eliminate one monster from the combat and fight the other(s) normally, but you cannot choose to fight one and Run Away from the other(s). If you eliminate one monster, but then run from the other(s), you don’t get any levels or Treasure!\\n---\\n----\\n\\nQ: Can I play a Go Up a Level card on another player?\\nWalk me through this context in manageable parts step by step, summarizing and analyzing as we go.\\n\\nAI: content='Let\\\\'s analyze the given context step by step:\\\\n\\\\n1. \\\"ONE-SHOT” TREASURES: One-shot Treasures can be played from your hand or from the table and must be discarded after the effect is resolved or at the end of combat.\\\\n2. OTHER TREASURES: These cards can be played at any time, even during combat. Examples include Go Up a Level cards and Hireling cards. Go Up a Level cards can be played on yourself or any other player, but you cannot use it to give a player the winning level.\\\\n3. DEATH: When a player dies, they lose all their stuff but keep their Classes, Races, Levels, and any Curses. Players must loot the body of the dead player, and cards cannot be given to the dead player.\\\\n4. LOOTING THE BODY: The player with the highest Level chooses a card, then everyone else follows in Level order, resolving ties with a die roll. Once everyone has chosen a card, discard the rest.\\\\n5. NEWLY REVIVED PLAYER: The newly revived player cannot receive cards for any reason and cannot level up or win the game. On their next turn, they draw cards as if starting a new game.\\\\n6. CONFLICTS BETWEEN CARDS AND RULES: In most cases, if a card contradicts a rule, the card takes precedence unless it explicitly states otherwise.\\\\n7. ITEM ENHANCERS: These cards must be played on an Item you already have in play and cannot be moved to a new Item.\\\\n8. MONSTER ENHANCERS: These cards can be played by any player during combat and affect the combat strength and Treasure value of monsters.\\\\n9. MULTIPLE MONSTERS: If a player fights multiple monsters, they must defeat their combined combat strengths. Special abilities apply to the entire fight, but a player cannot choose to fight one and Run Away from the others without getting any levels or Treasure.\\\\n\\\\nBased on the context provided, a Go Up a Level card can be played on another player, but it cannot be used to give a player the winning level.'\\nHuman: Now revise your answer. Be concise and remove any unrelated information to the question.\"\n",

At the start of your turn before doing anything else, draw a face-down Door card, which you may play or not. Then arrange cards and Kick Open The Door normally, If you Loot The Room, draw a face-down Treasure, not a Door.\\nUsually, a Curse affects its victim immediately (if it can) and is then discarded. However, some Curses give a penalty later in the game or have a continuing effect. Keep these cards until you get rid of the Curse or the penalty takes effect. (Curse cards you keep as a reminder may not be discarded to power Class or Race abilities. Nice try!) You can also allow shared victories — if a player reaches Level 10 in a fight where you are the helper, you also win the game, no matter what Note: If someone plays a “your next combat” Curse on you while you are Level you are.\\nin combat, it counts in that combat!

Don’t play a monster you can't handle, unless you're sure you can count on getting help (see p- 4)!\\nLoot The Room: Draw a second card from the Door deck, face down, and place it in your hand.\\n(3) Charity: If you have more than five cards in your hand, you must play enough cards to get you to five or below — for instance, you can play Curses, sell Items from your hand, or play Items to the table. If you cannot reduce your hand to five cards, or do not want to, you must give the excess cards to the player with the lowest Level. If players are tied for lowest, divide the cards as evenly as possible, but it's up to you who gets the bigger set(s) of leftovers.

You could help another player by using a one-shot to strengthen their side. Of course, you can “accidentally” strengthen the monster with it, instead. . .\\nPlay a monster enhancer. These cards (usually) make a monster stronger .. . and give it more Treasure. You can play these either during your own combats or during someone else's combat.\\nAdd a monster from your hand to join the combat, either with a Wandering Monster card or by using the special Undead rule.\\nBackstab a player in combat, if you're a Thief.\\nCurse them, if you have a Curse card.\\n\\nREWARDS\\nWhen you kill a monster, you get one level per monster, unless the monster card says something else, and you get all its Treasure! Each monster has a Treasure number on the bottom of its card. Draw that many Treasures, modified by any monster enhancers played on it. Draw face-down if you killed the monster alone. Draw face-up, so the whole party can see what you got, if someone helped you, even if they aren't taking any Treasures. (Sucker.)\\nIf you defeat a monster by nonlethal means, you do not get a level and you may or may not get the Treasure, depending on the method.\\nTreasure cards can be played as soon as you get them, even if you are the helper.\\n---\\n----\\n\\nQ: Can I play a Curse while in combat?\\nWalk me through this context in manageable parts step by step, summarizing and analyzing as we go.\"\n",

Reducing someone's abilities just as they think they have killed a monster is a lot of fun.\\nIf a Curse can apply to more than one Item, the victim decides which Item is lost & or Cursed. OO Ifa Curse applies to something you don't have, ignore it. For instance, if you draw Lose Your Armor and you have no Armor, nothing happens; discard the card.

When your cards are arranged the way you want, go to phase iL (1) Kick Open The Door: Draw one card from the Door deck and turn it face up.\\nIf it’s a monster, you must fight it. See Combat, p- 3. If the card is a curse - see Curses, p- Sait applies to you immediately (if it can) and is discarded (unless it has a persistent effect or you keep the card as a reminder of an upcoming effect).\\nIf you draw any other card, you may either put it in your hand or play it immediately.\\n(2) Look For Trouble/Loot The Room: If you fought a monster in phase IL, skip this phase and go to phase Be If you did NOT draw a monster when you first opened the door, you have two choices: either Look For Trouble or Loot The Room.\\nLook For Trouble: Play a monster from your hand and fight it, just as if you had found it when you kicked open the door. Don’t play a monster you can't handle, unless you're sure you can count on getting help (see p- 4)!\\nLoot The Room: Draw a second card from the Door deck, face down, and place it in your hand.\\n(3) Charity: If you have more than five cards in your hand, you must play enough cards to get you to five or below — for instance, you can play Curses, sell Items from your hand, or play Items to the table. If you cannot reduce your hand to five cards, or do not want to, you must give the excess cards to the player with the lowest Level. If players are tied for lowest, divide the cards as evenly as possible, but it's up to you who gets the bigger set(s) of leftovers. If YOU are the lowest or tied for lowest, just discard the excess.\\nAs soon as you are finished with Charity, the next player's turn begins.\\n\\nAg\\n---\\n---\\nNAME: munchkin_rules/munchkin_rules-1.pdf\\nPAGE: 4\\nPASSAGE:\\nInterfering With Combat\\nYou can interfere with others’ combats in several ways, including: Use a one-shot card. You could help another player by using a one-shot to strengthen their side. Of course, you can “accidentally” strengthen the monster with it, instead. . .\\nPlay a monster enhancer. These cards (usually) make a monster stronger .. . and give it more Treasure. You can play these either during your own combats or during someone else's combat.\\nAdd a monster from your hand to join the combat, either with a Wandering Monster card or by using the special Undead rule.\\nBackstab a player in combat, if you're a Thief.\\nCurse them, if you have a Curse card.\\n\\nREWARDS\\nWhen you kill a monster, you get one level per monster, unless the monster card says something else, and you get all its Treasure! Each monster has a Treasure number on the bottom of its card. Draw that many Treasures, modified by any monster enhancers played on it. Draw face-down if you killed the monster alone. Draw face-up, so the whole party can see what you got, if someone helped you, even if they aren't taking any Treasures. (Sucker.)\\nIf you defeat a monster by nonlethal means, you do not get a level and you may or may not get the Treasure, depending on the method.\\nTreasure cards can be played as soon as you get them, even if you are the helper.\\n---\\n----\\n\\nQ: Can I play a Curse while in combat?\\nWalk me through this context in manageable parts step by step, summarizing and analyzing as we go.\\n\\nAI: content='In the given context, we have two main parts to consider:\\\\n\\\\n1. Faster Play Rules: This rule suggests the addition of a \\\"phase 0\\\" called \\\"Listen At The Door\\\" where a player can draw a face-down Door card and play or not.\\\\n\\\\n2. CURSES: This rule mentions that Curse cards are drawn face-up during the Kick Open The Door phase and applied to the person who drew them. If acquired some other way, such as by Looting The Room, Curse cards go into the hand and may be played on any player at any time.\\\\n\\\\nBased on the provided context, during the \\\"Listen At The Door\\\" phase, you can play a Curse on another player. However, during combat, the only instances where you can play a Curse are when it\\\\'s a \\\"your next combat\\\" Curse played during your turn or a \\\"your next turn\\\" Curse played during someone else\\\\'s turn.\\\\n\\\\nSo, yes, you can play a Curse while in combat, but only under specific conditions like \\\"your next combat\\\" or \\\"your next turn\\\" Curses.'\\nHuman: Now revise your answer. Be concise and remove any unrelated information to the question.\"\n",

Do not use any other information. Never use the word \\\"excerpts\\\" in your answer. Simply refer to the context as the rules.\\n\\n----\\n---\\nNAME: munchkin_rules/munchkin_rules-1.pdf\\nPAGE: 2\\nPASSAGE:\\nCHARACTER STATS\\nEach character is basically a collection of weapons, armor, and magic items, with three stats: Level, Race, and Class. For instance, you might describe your character as a “Level 8 Elf Wizard with Boots of Butt-Kicking, a Staff of Napalm, and the Kneepads of Allure.” Level: This is a measure of how generally buff and studly you are. When the rules or cards refer to your Level, capitalized, they mean this number. You gain a level when you kill a monster, or when a card says that you do. You can also sell Items to buy levels (see Items). You lose a level when a card says you do. Your Level can never go below 1. However, your combat strength can be negative, if you get hit by a Curse or suffer some other kind of penalty.\\nClass: Characters may be Warriors, Wizards, Thieves, or Clerics. If you have no Class card in front of you, you have no class. Yeah, I know, we did that one already.\\nEach Class has special abilities, shown on the cards. You gain the abilities of a Class the moment you play its card in front of you, and lose them as soon as you discard that card. Some Class abilities are powered by discards. You may discard any card, in play or in your hand, to power a special ability.\\nSee the Class cards for when abilities can be used. Note that a Thief cannot steal while he or the target is fighting - and as soon as a monster is revealed, the fight is on!\\nYou can discard a Class card at any time, even in combat: “I don't wanna be a wizard anymore.” When you discard a Class card, you become classless until you play another Class card.\\nYou may not belong to more than one class at once unless you play the Super Munchkin card.\\nRace: Characters may be Humans, Elves, Dwarves, or Halflings. If you have no Race card in front of you, you are human.\\n---\\n---\\nNAME: munchkin_rules/munchkin_rules-1.pdf\\nPAGE: 3\\nPASSAGE:\\nITEMS\\nMost Treasures are Items. Items have a Gold Piece value. “No Value” is equivalent to zero Gold Pieces, and a “No Value” card is considered an Item.\\nAll Items you have in play are considered “carried.” Items that are actually giving you a bonus are “equipped.” You should indicate Items that are not equipped by turning the cards sideways. You may not alter the status of your Items during a combat or while running away.\\nAnyone can carry any Item (except for extra Big items; see below), but you may equip only one Headgear, one suit of Armor, one pair of Footgear, and two “I Hand” Items (or one “2 Hands” Item) . . . unless you have a card that lets you ignore these limits, such as Hireling or Cheat!, or unless one of the cards says otherwise. If you are carrying two Headgear cards, for instance, you can equip only one of them at a time.\\nLikewise, some Items have restrictions: for instance, the Mace of Sharpness can only be wielded by a Cleric. Its bonus only counts for someone who is, at the moment, a Cleric.\\nYou cannot discard Item cards “just because.” You may sell Items for a level, trade Items with other players, or give an Item to another player who wants it (see below). You may discard Items to power certain Class and Race abilities. And a Curse or a monster's Bad Stuff (see p. 5) may force you to get rid of something!\\nBig Items: You may carry any number of Small items, but only one Big one. (Any item not marked Big is considered Small.) You may not discard one Big item to play another; you must sell the first Item, trade it, lose it to a Curse or Bad Stuff, or discard it to power a Class or Race ability.\\n---\\n---\\nNAME: munchkin_rules/munchkin_rules-1.pdf\\nPAGE: 3\\nPASSAGE:\\nCOMBAT\\nTo fight a monster, compare its combat strength to yours. Combat strength is the total of Level plus all modifiers - positive or negative - given by Items and other cards. If the monster's combat strength is equal to yours, or greater, you lose the combat and must Run Away (see p. 5). If your combat strength totals more than the monster's — note that monsters win ties! — you kill it and goupa level (two levels for some big monsters). You'll also get the number of Treasures shown on its card.\\nSometimes a card will let you get rid of the monster without killing it. This is still “winning,” but you don't get a level. Unless the ability says otherwise, you don’t get the Treasures, either. If the last monster is removed from a combat, it ends instantly.\\nSome monster cards have special powers that affect combat — a bonus against a Race or Class, for instance. Be sure to check these!\\nYou and the other players may play one-shot Treasures or use Class or Race abilities to help or harm you in your combat. Some Door cards may also be played into a combat, such as monster enhancers (see below).\\nIf you kill a monster (or monsters!), discard the monster(s) and any other cards played, and claim your rewards. But note: someone may play a hostile card on you, or use a special power, just as you think you have won. When you kill a monster, you must wait a reasonable time, defined as about 2.6 seconds, for anyone else to speak up. After that, you have really killed the monster, and you really get the level(s) and Treasures, though they can still whine and argue.\\n---\\n---\\nNAME: munchkin_rules/princesses_rules.pdf\\nPAGE: 1\\nPASSAGE:\\nDeveloped by Andrew Hackard\\n\\nBased on Steve Jackson’s Munchkin\\n\\nIllustrated by John Kovalic\\n\\nAdditional Material by Steve Jackson, Devin Lewis, and Darryll Silva\\nChief Operating Officer: Philip Reed Managing Editor: Miranda Horner Munchkin Czar: Andrew Hackard Munchkin Hireling: Devin Lewis Production Manager: Samuel Mitschke Production Artist: Benjamin Williams Prepress Checker: Monica Stephens Marketing Director: Leonard Balsera Director of Sales: Ross Jepson\\nThanks to Stacy Beckwith, Max Clontz, Sabrina Gonzalez, Miranda Horner, John Kovalic, Bridget Westerman, Elisabeth Zakes, and the Munchkin Brain ‘Trust for regal suggestions and advice.\\nMunchkin, the Munchkin characters, Warehouse 23, the all-seeing pyramid, and the names of all products published by Steve Jackson Games Incorporated are trademarks or registered trademarks of Ste Jackson Games Incorporated, or used under license. ‘Munchkin Princesses is copyright © 2014 by Steve Jackson Games Incorporated.

Simply refer to the context as the rules.\\n\\n----\\n---\\nNAME: munchkin_rules/munchkin_rules-1.pdf\\nPAGE: 2\\nPASSAGE:\\nCHARACTER STATS\\nEach character is basically a collection of weapons, armor, and magic items, with three stats: Level, Race, and Class. For instance, you might describe your character as a “Level 8 Elf Wizard with Boots of Butt-Kicking, a Staff of Napalm, and the Kneepads of Allure.” Level: This is a measure of how generally buff and studly you are. When the rules or cards refer to your Level, capitalized, they mean this number. You gain a level when you kill a monster, or when a card says that you do. You can also sell Items to buy levels (see Items). You lose a level when a card says you do. Your Level can never go below 1. However, your combat strength can be negative, if you get hit by a Curse or suffer some other kind of penalty.\\nClass: Characters may be Warriors, Wizards, Thieves, or Clerics. If you have no Class card in front of you, you have no class. Yeah, I know, we did that one already.\\nEach Class has special abilities, shown on the cards. You gain the abilities of a Class the moment you play its card in front of you, and lose them as soon as you discard that card. Some Class abilities are powered by discards. You may discard any card, in play or in your hand, to power a special ability.\\nSee the Class cards for when abilities can be used. Note that a Thief cannot steal while he or the target is fighting - and as soon as a monster is revealed, the fight is on!\\nYou can discard a Class card at any time, even in combat: “I don't wanna be a wizard anymore.” When you discard a Class card, you become classless until you play another Class card.\\nYou may not belong to more than one class at once unless you play the Super Munchkin card.\\nRace: Characters may be Humans, Elves, Dwarves, or Halflings. If you have no Race card in front of you, you are human.\\n---\\n---\\nNAME: munchkin_rules/munchkin_rules-1.pdf\\nPAGE: 3\\nPASSAGE:\\nITEMS\\nMost Treasures are Items. Items have a Gold Piece value. “No Value” is equivalent to zero Gold Pieces, and a “No Value” card is considered an Item.\\nAll Items you have in play are considered “carried.” Items that are actually giving you a bonus are “equipped.” You should indicate Items that are not equipped by turning the cards sideways. You may not alter the status of your Items during a combat or while running away.\\nAnyone can carry any Item (except for extra Big items; see below), but you may equip only one Headgear, one suit of Armor, one pair of Footgear, and two “I Hand” Items (or one “2 Hands” Item) . . . unless you have a card that lets you ignore these limits, such as Hireling or Cheat!, or unless one of the cards says otherwise. If you are carrying two Headgear cards, for instance, you can equip only one of them at a time.\\nLikewise, some Items have restrictions: for instance, the Mace of Sharpness can only be wielded by a Cleric. Its bonus only counts for someone who is, at the moment, a Cleric.\\nYou cannot discard Item cards “just because.” You may sell Items for a level, trade Items with other players, or give an Item to another player who wants it (see below). You may discard Items to power certain Class and Race abilities. And a Curse or a monster's Bad Stuff (see p. 5) may force you to get rid of something!\\nBig Items: You may carry any number of Small items, but only one Big one. (Any item not marked Big is considered Small.) You may not discard one Big item to play another; you must sell the first Item, trade it, lose it to a Curse or Bad Stuff, or discard it to power a Class or Race ability.\\n---\\n---\\nNAME: munchkin_rules/munchkin_rules-1.pdf\\nPAGE: 3\\nPASSAGE:\\nCOMBAT\\nTo fight a monster, compare its combat strength to yours. Combat strength is the total of Level plus all modifiers - positive or negative - given by Items and other cards. If the monster's combat strength is equal to yours, or greater, you lose the combat and must Run Away (see p. 5). If your combat strength totals more than the monster's — note that monsters win ties! — you kill it and goupa level (two levels for some big monsters). You'll also get the number of Treasures shown on its card.\\nSometimes a card will let you get rid of the monster without killing it. This is still “winning,” but you don't get a level. Unless the ability says otherwise, you don’t get the Treasures, either. If the last monster is removed from a combat, it ends instantly.\\nSome monster cards have special powers that affect combat — a bonus against a Race or Class, for instance. Be sure to check these!\\nYou and the other players may play one-shot Treasures or use Class or Race abilities to help or harm you in your combat. Some Door cards may also be played into a combat, such as monster enhancers (see below).\\nIf you kill a monster (or monsters!), discard the monster(s) and any other cards played, and claim your rewards. But note: someone may play a hostile card on you, or use a special power, just as you think you have won. When you kill a monster, you must wait a reasonable time, defined as about 2.6 seconds, for anyone else to speak up. After that, you have really killed the monster, and you really get the level(s) and Treasures, though they can still whine and argue.\\n---\\n---\\nNAME: munchkin_rules/princesses_rules.pdf\\nPAGE: 1\\nPASSAGE:\\nDeveloped by Andrew Hackard\\n\\nBased on Steve Jackson’s Munchkin\\n\\nIllustrated by John Kovalic\\n\\nAdditional Material by Steve Jackson, Devin Lewis, and Darryll Silva\\nChief Operating Officer: Philip Reed Managing Editor: Miranda Horner Munchkin Czar: Andrew Hackard Munchkin Hireling: Devin Lewis Production Manager: Samuel Mitschke Production Artist: Benjamin Williams Prepress Checker: Monica Stephens Marketing Director: Leonard Balsera Director of Sales: Ross Jepson\\nThanks to Stacy Beckwith, Max Clontz, Sabrina Gonzalez, Miranda Horner, John Kovalic, Bridget Westerman, Elisabeth Zakes, and the Munchkin Brain ‘Trust for regal suggestions and advice.\\nMunchkin, the Munchkin characters, Warehouse 23, the all-seeing pyramid, and the names of all products published by Steve Jackson Games Incorporated are trademarks or registered trademarks of Ste Jackson Games Incorporated, or used under license. ‘Munchkin Princesses is copyright © 2014 by Steve Jackson Games Incorporated.

On page 1, under \\\"Items,\\\" it states, \\\"You cannot discard Item cards \\\\'just because.\\\\' You may sell Items for a level, trade Items with other players, or give an Item to another player who wants it (see below). You may discard Items to power certain Class and Race abilities. And a Curse or a monster\\\\'s Bad Stuff (see p. 5) may force you to get rid of something!\\\"\\\\n3. In the context of \\\"Conflicts Between Cards and Rules\\\" on page 1, it says, \\\"Nothing can reduce a player below Level 1, although card effects might reduce a player\\\\'s or a monster\\\\'s combat strength (p. 3) below 1.\\\"\\\\n\\\\nBased on these excerpts, you can get rid of your Class card by selling it for a level, trading it with another player, giving it to a player who wants it, or discarding it to power a Class ability. However, you cannot discard the Class card just because; it must be a part of one of these actions or effects.'\\nHuman: Now revise your answer.

For instance, you might describe your character as a “Level 8 Elf Wizard with Boots of Butt-Kicking, a Staff of Napalm, and the Kneepads of Allure.” Level: This is a measure of how generally buff and studly you are. When the rules or cards refer to your Level, capitalized, they mean this number. You gain a level when you kill a monster, or when a card says that you do. You can also sell Items to buy levels (see Items). You lose a level when a card says you do. Your Level can never go below 1. However, your combat strength can be negative, if you get hit by a Curse or suffer some other kind of penalty.\\nClass: Characters may be Warriors, Wizards, Thieves, or Clerics. If you have no Class card in front of you, you have no class. Yeah, I know, we did that one already.\\nEach Class has special abilities, shown on the cards. You gain the abilities of a Class the moment you play its card in front of you, and lose them as soon as you discard that card. Some Class abilities are powered by discards. You may discard any card, in play or in your hand, to power a special ability.\\nSee the Class cards for when abilities can be used. Note that a Thief cannot steal while he or the target is fighting - and as soon as a monster is revealed, the fight is on!\\nYou can discard a Class card at any time, even in combat: “I don't wanna be a wizard anymore.” When you discard a Class card, you become classless until you play another Class card.\\nYou may not belong to more than one class at once unless you play the Super Munchkin card.\\nRace: Characters may be Humans, Elves, Dwarves, or Halflings. If you have no Race card in front of you, you are human.\\n---\\n---\\nNAME: munchkin_rules/munchkin_rules-1.pdf\\nPAGE: 3\\nPASSAGE:\\nITEMS\\nMost Treasures are Items. Items have a Gold Piece value. “No Value” is equivalent to zero Gold Pieces, and a “No Value” card is considered an Item.\\nAll Items you have in play are considered “carried.” Items that are actually giving you a bonus are “equipped.” You should indicate Items that are not equipped by turning the cards sideways. You may not alter the status of your Items during a combat or while running away.\\nAnyone can carry any Item (except for extra Big items; see below), but you may equip only one Headgear, one suit of Armor, one pair of Footgear, and two “I Hand” Items (or one “2 Hands” Item) . . . unless you have a card that lets you ignore these limits, such as Hireling or Cheat!, or unless one of the cards says otherwise. If you are carrying two Headgear cards, for instance, you can equip only one of them at a time.\\nLikewise, some Items have restrictions: for instance, the Mace of Sharpness can only be wielded by a Cleric. Its bonus only counts for someone who is, at the moment, a Cleric.\\nYou cannot discard Item cards “just because.” You may sell Items for a level, trade Items with other players, or give an Item to another player who wants it (see below). You may discard Items to power certain Class and Race abilities. And a Curse or a monster's Bad Stuff (see p. 5) may force you to get rid of something!\\nBig Items: You may carry any number of Small items, but only one Big one. (Any item not marked Big is considered Small.) You may not discard one Big item to play another; you must sell the first Item, trade it, lose it to a Curse or Bad Stuff, or discard it to power a Class or Race ability.\\n---\\n---\\nNAME: munchkin_rules/munchkin_rules-1.pdf\\nPAGE: 3\\nPASSAGE:\\nCOMBAT\\nTo fight a monster, compare its combat strength to yours. Combat strength is the total of Level plus all modifiers - positive or negative - given by Items and other cards. If the monster's combat strength is equal to yours, or greater, you lose the combat and must Run Away (see p. 5). If your combat strength totals more than the monster's — note that monsters win ties! — you kill it and goupa level (two levels for some big monsters). You'll also get the number of Treasures shown on its card.\\nSometimes a card will let you get rid of the monster without killing it. This is still “winning,” but you don't get a level. Unless the ability says otherwise, you don’t get the Treasures, either. If the last monster is removed from a combat, it ends instantly.\\nSome monster cards have special powers that affect combat — a bonus against a Race or Class, for instance. Be sure to check these!\\nYou and the other players may play one-shot Treasures or use Class or Race abilities to help or harm you in your combat. Some Door cards may also be played into a combat, such as monster enhancers (see below).\\nIf you kill a monster (or monsters!), discard the monster(s) and any other cards played, and claim your rewards. But note: someone may play a hostile card on you, or use a special power, just as you think you have won. When you kill a monster, you must wait a reasonable time, defined as about 2.6 seconds, for anyone else to speak up. After that, you have really killed the monster, and you really get the level(s) and Treasures, though they can still whine and argue.\\n---\\n---\\nNAME: munchkin_rules/princesses_rules.pdf\\nPAGE: 1\\nPASSAGE:\\nDeveloped by Andrew Hackard\\n\\nBased on Steve Jackson’s Munchkin\\n\\nIllustrated by John Kovalic\\n\\nAdditional Material by Steve Jackson, Devin Lewis, and Darryll Silva\\nChief Operating Officer: Philip Reed Managing Editor: Miranda Horner Munchkin Czar: Andrew Hackard Munchkin Hireling: Devin Lewis Production Manager: Samuel Mitschke Production Artist: Benjamin Williams Prepress Checker: Monica Stephens Marketing Director: Leonard Balsera Director of Sales: Ross Jepson\\nThanks to Stacy Beckwith, Max Clontz, Sabrina Gonzalez, Miranda Horner, John Kovalic, Bridget Westerman, Elisabeth Zakes, and the Munchkin Brain ‘Trust for regal suggestions and advice.\\nMunchkin, the Munchkin characters, Warehouse 23, the all-seeing pyramid, and the names of all products published by Steve Jackson Games Incorporated are trademarks or registered trademarks of Ste Jackson Games Incorporated, or used under license. ‘Munchkin Princesses is copyright © 2014 by Steve Jackson Games Incorporated.

Simply refer to the context as the rules.\\n\\n----\\n---\\nNAME: munchkin_rules/munchkin_rules-1.pdf\\nPAGE: 2\\nPASSAGE:\\nCHARACTER STATS\\nEach character is basically a collection of weapons, armor, and magic items, with three stats: Level, Race, and Class. For instance, you might describe your character as a “Level 8 Elf Wizard with Boots of Butt-Kicking, a Staff of Napalm, and the Kneepads of Allure.” Level: This is a measure of how generally buff and studly you are. When the rules or cards refer to your Level, capitalized, they mean this number. You gain a level when you kill a monster, or when a card says that you do. You can also sell Items to buy levels (see Items). You lose a level when a card says you do. Your Level can never go below 1. However, your combat strength can be negative, if you get hit by a Curse or suffer some other kind of penalty.\\nClass: Characters may be Warriors, Wizards, Thieves, or Clerics. If you have no Class card in front of you, you have no class. Yeah, I know, we did that one already.\\nEach Class has special abilities, shown on the cards. You gain the abilities of a Class the moment you play its card in front of you, and lose them as soon as you discard that card. Some Class abilities are powered by discards. You may discard any card, in play or in your hand, to power a special ability.\\nSee the Class cards for when abilities can be used. Note that a Thief cannot steal while he or the target is fighting - and as soon as a monster is revealed, the fight is on!\\nYou can discard a Class card at any time, even in combat: “I don't wanna be a wizard anymore.” When you discard a Class card, you become classless until you play another Class card.\\nYou may not belong to more than one class at once unless you play the Super Munchkin card.\\nRace: Characters may be Humans, Elves, Dwarves, or Halflings. If you have no Race card in front of you, you are human.\\n---\\n---\\nNAME: munchkin_rules/munchkin_rules-1.pdf\\nPAGE: 3\\nPASSAGE:\\nITEMS\\nMost Treasures are Items. Items have a Gold Piece value. “No Value” is equivalent to zero Gold Pieces, and a “No Value” card is considered an Item.\\nAll Items you have in play are considered “carried.” Items that are actually giving you a bonus are “equipped.” You should indicate Items that are not equipped by turning the cards sideways. You may not alter the status of your Items during a combat or while running away.\\nAnyone can carry any Item (except for extra Big items; see below), but you may equip only one Headgear, one suit of Armor, one pair of Footgear, and two “I Hand” Items (or one “2 Hands” Item) . . . unless you have a card that lets you ignore these limits, such as Hireling or Cheat!, or unless one of the cards says otherwise. If you are carrying two Headgear cards, for instance, you can equip only one of them at a time.\\nLikewise, some Items have restrictions: for instance, the Mace of Sharpness can only be wielded by a Cleric. Its bonus only counts for someone who is, at the moment, a Cleric.\\nYou cannot discard Item cards “just because.” You may sell Items for a level, trade Items with other players, or give an Item to another player who wants it (see below). You may discard Items to power certain Class and Race abilities. And a Curse or a monster's Bad Stuff (see p. 5) may force you to get rid of something!\\nBig Items: You may carry any number of Small items, but only one Big one. (Any item not marked Big is considered Small.) You may not discard one Big item to play another; you must sell the first Item, trade it, lose it to a Curse or Bad Stuff, or discard it to power a Class or Race ability.\\n---\\n---\\nNAME: munchkin_rules/munchkin_rules-1.pdf\\nPAGE: 3\\nPASSAGE:\\nCOMBAT\\nTo fight a monster, compare its combat strength to yours. Combat strength is the total of Level plus all modifiers - positive or negative - given by Items and other cards. If the monster's combat strength is equal to yours, or greater, you lose the combat and must Run Away (see p. 5). If your combat strength totals more than the monster's — note that monsters win ties! — you kill it and goupa level (two levels for some big monsters). You'll also get the number of Treasures shown on its card.\\nSometimes a card will let you get rid of the monster without killing it. This is still “winning,” but you don't get a level. Unless the ability says otherwise, you don’t get the Treasures, either. If the last monster is removed from a combat, it ends instantly.\\nSome monster cards have special powers that affect combat — a bonus against a Race or Class, for instance. Be sure to check these!\\nYou and the other players may play one-shot Treasures or use Class or Race abilities to help or harm you in your combat. Some Door cards may also be played into a combat, such as monster enhancers (see below).\\nIf you kill a monster (or monsters!), discard the monster(s) and any other cards played, and claim your rewards. But note: someone may play a hostile card on you, or use a special power, just as you think you have won. When you kill a monster, you must wait a reasonable time, defined as about 2.6 seconds, for anyone else to speak up. After that, you have really killed the monster, and you really get the level(s) and Treasures, though they can still whine and argue.\\n---\\n---\\nNAME: munchkin_rules/princesses_rules.pdf\\nPAGE: 1\\nPASSAGE:\\nDeveloped by Andrew Hackard\\n\\nBased on Steve Jackson’s Munchkin\\n\\nIllustrated by John Kovalic\\n\\nAdditional Material by Steve Jackson, Devin Lewis, and Darryll Silva\\nChief Operating Officer: Philip Reed Managing Editor: Miranda Horner Munchkin Czar: Andrew Hackard Munchkin Hireling: Devin Lewis Production Manager: Samuel Mitschke Production Artist: Benjamin Williams Prepress Checker: Monica Stephens Marketing Director: Leonard Balsera Director of Sales: Ross Jepson\\nThanks to Stacy Beckwith, Max Clontz, Sabrina Gonzalez, Miranda Horner, John Kovalic, Bridget Westerman, Elisabeth Zakes, and the Munchkin Brain ‘Trust for regal suggestions and advice.\\nMunchkin, the Munchkin characters, Warehouse 23, the all-seeing pyramid, and the names of all products published by Steve Jackson Games Incorporated are trademarks or registered trademarks of Ste Jackson Games Incorporated, or used under license. ‘Munchkin Princesses is copyright © 2014 by Steve Jackson Games Incorporated.

The game involves characters with specific Levels, Races, and Classes, as well as acquiring various Items and defeating monsters. The rules are organized into different sections, and the question focuses on getting rid of a Class card.\\\\n\\\\n1. The first passage explains that each character has a Level, Race, and Class. A Class can be a Warrior, Wizard, Thief, or Cleric, and each Class has special abilities. You can gain a Class\\\\'s abilities by playing its card in front of you and lose them when you discard the card.\\\\n\\\\n2. The second passage introduces Items, which include Treasures. You can have multiple Items but can only equip a limited number of Items depending on their type. Some Items can only be wielded by specific Classes, and you cannot discard an Item without a valid reason or without following certain restrictions.\\\\n\\\\n3. The third passage explains combat, which involves comparing your combat strength with a monster\\\\'s combat strength. If your combat strength is higher, you kill the monster and gain a level and Treasures. Some monsters have special powers that affect combat.\\\\n\\\\n4. The last passage in the Munchkin Princesses rules states that anyone with a Princess card can become a Princess, keep the card as long as they want, and discard it at any time.\\\\n\\\\n5. The passage from the rules on \\\"Conflicts Between Cards and Rules\\\" stipulates that in most cases, when the rulesheet disagrees with a card, the card should be followed.

Simply refer to the context as the rules.\\n\\n----\\n---\\nNAME: munchkin_rules/munchkin_rules-1.pdf\\nPAGE: 2\\nPASSAGE:\\nCHARACTER STATS\\nEach character is basically a collection of weapons, armor, and magic items, with three stats: Level, Race, and Class. For instance, you might describe your character as a “Level 8 Elf Wizard with Boots of Butt-Kicking, a Staff of Napalm, and the Kneepads of Allure.” Level: This is a measure of how generally buff and studly you are. When the rules or cards refer to your Level, capitalized, they mean this number. You gain a level when you kill a monster, or when a card says that you do. You can also sell Items to buy levels (see Items). You lose a level when a card says you do. Your Level can never go below 1. However, your combat strength can be negative, if you get hit by a Curse or suffer some other kind of penalty.\\nClass: Characters may be Warriors, Wizards, Thieves, or Clerics. If you have no Class card in front of you, you have no class. Yeah, I know, we did that one already.\\nEach Class has special abilities, shown on the cards. You gain the abilities of a Class the moment you play its card in front of you, and lose them as soon as you discard that card. Some Class abilities are powered by discards. You may discard any card, in play or in your hand, to power a special ability.\\nSee the Class cards for when abilities can be used. Note that a Thief cannot steal while he or the target is fighting - and as soon as a monster is revealed, the fight is on!\\nYou can discard a Class card at any time, even in combat: “I don't wanna be a wizard anymore.” When you discard a Class card, you become classless until you play another Class card.\\nYou may not belong to more than one class at once unless you play the Super Munchkin card.\\nRace: Characters may be Humans, Elves, Dwarves, or Halflings. If you have no Race card in front of you, you are human.\\n---\\n---\\nNAME: munchkin_rules/munchkin_rules-1.pdf\\nPAGE: 3\\nPASSAGE:\\nITEMS\\nMost Treasures are Items. Items have a Gold Piece value. “No Value” is equivalent to zero Gold Pieces, and a “No Value” card is considered an Item.\\nAll Items you have in play are considered “carried.” Items that are actually giving you a bonus are “equipped.” You should indicate Items that are not equipped by turning the cards sideways. You may not alter the status of your Items during a combat or while running away.\\nAnyone can carry any Item (except for extra Big items; see below), but you may equip only one Headgear, one suit of Armor, one pair of Footgear, and two “I Hand” Items (or one “2 Hands” Item) . . . unless you have a card that lets you ignore these limits, such as Hireling or Cheat!, or unless one of the cards says otherwise. If you are carrying two Headgear cards, for instance, you can equip only one of them at a time.\\nLikewise, some Items have restrictions: for instance, the Mace of Sharpness can only be wielded by a Cleric. Its bonus only counts for someone who is, at the moment, a Cleric.\\nYou cannot discard Item cards “just because.” You may sell Items for a level, trade Items with other players, or give an Item to another player who wants it (see below). You may discard Items to power certain Class and Race abilities. And a Curse or a monster's Bad Stuff (see p. 5) may force you to get rid of something!\\nBig Items: You may carry any number of Small items, but only one Big one. (Any item not marked Big is considered Small.) You may not discard one Big item to play another; you must sell the first Item, trade it, lose it to a Curse or Bad Stuff, or discard it to power a Class or Race ability.\\n---\\n---\\nNAME: munchkin_rules/munchkin_rules-1.pdf\\nPAGE: 2\\nPASSAGE:\\nSUPER MUNCHKIN AND HALF-BREED\\nThese cards may be played whenever it is legal to play a Class or Race, as long as you have an appropriate card (Class for Super Munchkin, Race for Half-Breed) to attach it to. You cannot have more than one of the same Class or Race card in play at once.\\nIf you play Super Munchkin with one Class, you get all the advantages of being that Class (the ability to equip Class-only Items, monsters with penalties against that Class suffer those penalties) and none of the disadvantages (you can equip Items forbidden to that Class, and monsters do not get bonuses because of your Class). If the Class has an ability that has a cost, however, you must still pay it - you aren't that Super! If you play Super Munchkin while you have two Classes, you have all the normal advantages and disadvantages of both Classes. (All of the above is also true for Half-Breed, just for Races.)\\n---\\n---\\nNAME: munchkin_rules/munchkin_rules-1.pdf\\nPAGE: 6\\nPASSAGE:\\nFaster Play Rules\\nFor a faster game, you can adda “phase 0” called Listen At The Door. At the start of your turn before doing anything else, draw a face-down Door card, which you may play or not. Then arrange cards and Kick Open The Door normally, If you Loot The Room, draw a face-down Treasure, not a Door.\\nUsually, a Curse affects its victim immediately (if it can) and is then discarded. However, some Curses give a penalty later in the game or have a continuing effect. Keep these cards until you get rid of the Curse or the penalty takes effect. (Curse cards you keep as a reminder may not be discarded to power Class or Race abilities. Nice try!) You can also allow shared victories — if a player reaches Level 10 in a fight where you are the helper, you also win the game, no matter what Note: If someone plays a “your next combat” Curse on you while you are Level you are.\\nin combat, it counts in that combat! The same is true for a “your next turn” Curse played during your turn.\\nGame Design by Steve Jackson @ Illustrated by John Kovalic President/Editor-in-Chief: Steve Jackson @ Chief Executive Officer: Philip Reed @ Chief Operating Officer: Susan Bueno @ Chief Creative Officer: Sam Mitschke Munchkin Line Editor: Andrew Hackard @ Production Manager: Sabrina Gonzalez @ Production Artists: Alex Fernandez and Sabrina Gonzalez Project Manager: Darryll Silva @ Operations Manager: Randy Scheunemann @ Director of Sales: Ross Jepson Playtesters: Steve Brinich, Moe Chapman, Paul Chapman, Alain Dawson, Jessie D.

Do not use any other information. Never use the word \\\"excerpts\\\" in your answer. Simply refer to the context as the rules.\\n\\n----\\n---\\nNAME: munchkin_rules/munchkin_rules-1.pdf\\nPAGE: 2\\nPASSAGE:\\nCHARACTER STATS\\nEach character is basically a collection of weapons, armor, and magic items, with three stats: Level, Race, and Class. For instance, you might describe your character as a “Level 8 Elf Wizard with Boots of Butt-Kicking, a Staff of Napalm, and the Kneepads of Allure.” Level: This is a measure of how generally buff and studly you are. When the rules or cards refer to your Level, capitalized, they mean this number. You gain a level when you kill a monster, or when a card says that you do. You can also sell Items to buy levels (see Items). You lose a level when a card says you do. Your Level can never go below 1. However, your combat strength can be negative, if you get hit by a Curse or suffer some other kind of penalty.\\nClass: Characters may be Warriors, Wizards, Thieves, or Clerics. If you have no Class card in front of you, you have no class. Yeah, I know, we did that one already.\\nEach Class has special abilities, shown on the cards. You gain the abilities of a Class the moment you play its card in front of you, and lose them as soon as you discard that card. Some Class abilities are powered by discards. You may discard any card, in play or in your hand, to power a special ability.\\nSee the Class cards for when abilities can be used. Note that a Thief cannot steal while he or the target is fighting - and as soon as a monster is revealed, the fight is on!\\nYou can discard a Class card at any time, even in combat: “I don't wanna be a wizard anymore.” When you discard a Class card, you become classless until you play another Class card.\\nYou may not belong to more than one class at once unless you play the Super Munchkin card.\\nRace: Characters may be Humans, Elves, Dwarves, or Halflings. If you have no Race card in front of you, you are human.\\n---\\n---\\nNAME: munchkin_rules/munchkin_rules-1.pdf\\nPAGE: 3\\nPASSAGE:\\nITEMS\\nMost Treasures are Items. Items have a Gold Piece value. “No Value” is equivalent to zero Gold Pieces, and a “No Value” card is considered an Item.\\nAll Items you have in play are considered “carried.” Items that are actually giving you a bonus are “equipped.” You should indicate Items that are not equipped by turning the cards sideways. You may not alter the status of your Items during a combat or while running away.\\nAnyone can carry any Item (except for extra Big items; see below), but you may equip only one Headgear, one suit of Armor, one pair of Footgear, and two “I Hand” Items (or one “2 Hands” Item) . . . unless you have a card that lets you ignore these limits, such as Hireling or Cheat!, or unless one of the cards says otherwise. If you are carrying two Headgear cards, for instance, you can equip only one of them at a time.\\nLikewise, some Items have restrictions: for instance, the Mace of Sharpness can only be wielded by a Cleric. Its bonus only counts for someone who is, at the moment, a Cleric.\\nYou cannot discard Item cards “just because.” You may sell Items for a level, trade Items with other players, or give an Item to another player who wants it (see below). You may discard Items to power certain Class and Race abilities.

For instance, you might describe your character as a “Level 8 Elf Wizard with Boots of Butt-Kicking, a Staff of Napalm, and the Kneepads of Allure.” Level: This is a measure of how generally buff and studly you are. When the rules or cards refer to your Level, capitalized, they mean this number. You gain a level when you kill a monster, or when a card says that you do. You can also sell Items to buy levels (see Items). You lose a level when a card says you do. Your Level can never go below 1. However, your combat strength can be negative, if you get hit by a Curse or suffer some other kind of penalty.\\nClass: Characters may be Warriors, Wizards, Thieves, or Clerics. If you have no Class card in front of you, you have no class. Yeah, I know, we did that one already.\\nEach Class has special abilities, shown on the cards. You gain the abilities of a Class the moment you play its card in front of you, and lose them as soon as you discard that card. Some Class abilities are powered by discards. You may discard any card, in play or in your hand, to power a special ability.\\nSee the Class cards for when abilities can be used. Note that a Thief cannot steal while he or the target is fighting - and as soon as a monster is revealed, the fight is on!\\nYou can discard a Class card at any time, even in combat: “I don't wanna be a wizard anymore.” When you discard a Class card, you become classless until you play another Class card.\\nYou may not belong to more than one class at once unless you play the Super Munchkin card.\\nRace: Characters may be Humans, Elves, Dwarves, or Halflings. If you have no Race card in front of you, you are human.\\n---\\n---\\nNAME: munchkin_rules/munchkin_rules-1.pdf\\nPAGE: 3\\nPASSAGE:\\nITEMS\\nMost Treasures are Items. Items have a Gold Piece value. “No Value” is equivalent to zero Gold Pieces, and a “No Value” card is considered an Item.\\nAll Items you have in play are considered “carried.” Items that are actually giving you a bonus are “equipped.” You should indicate Items that are not equipped by turning the cards sideways. You may not alter the status of your Items during a combat or while running away.\\nAnyone can carry any Item (except for extra Big items; see below), but you may equip only one Headgear, one suit of Armor, one pair of Footgear, and two “I Hand” Items (or one “2 Hands” Item) . . . unless you have a card that lets you ignore these limits, such as Hireling or Cheat!, or unless one of the cards says otherwise. If you are carrying two Headgear cards, for instance, you can equip only one of them at a time.\\nLikewise, some Items have restrictions: for instance, the Mace of Sharpness can only be wielded by a Cleric. Its bonus only counts for someone who is, at the moment, a Cleric.\\nYou cannot discard Item cards “just because.” You may sell Items for a level, trade Items with other players, or give an Item to another player who wants it (see below).

Do not use any other information. Never use the word \\\"excerpts\\\" in your answer. Simply refer to the context as the rules.\\n\\n----\\n---\\nNAME: munchkin_rules/munchkin_rules-1.pdf\\nPAGE: 2\\nPASSAGE:\\nCHARACTER STATS\\nEach character is basically a collection of weapons, armor, and magic items, with three stats: Level, Race, and Class. For instance, you might describe your character as a “Level 8 Elf Wizard with Boots of Butt-Kicking, a Staff of Napalm, and the Kneepads of Allure.” Level: This is a measure of how generally buff and studly you are. When the rules or cards refer to your Level, capitalized, they mean this number. You gain a level when you kill a monster, or when a card says that you do. You can also sell Items to buy levels (see Items). You lose a level when a card says you do. Your Level can never go below 1. However, your combat strength can be negative, if you get hit by a Curse or suffer some other kind of penalty.\\nClass: Characters may be Warriors, Wizards, Thieves, or Clerics. If you have no Class card in front of you, you have no class. Yeah, I know, we did that one already.\\nEach Class has special abilities, shown on the cards. You gain the abilities of a Class the moment you play its card in front of you, and lose them as soon as you discard that card. Some Class abilities are powered by discards. You may discard any card, in play or in your hand, to power a special ability.\\nSee the Class cards for when abilities can be used. Note that a Thief cannot steal while he or the target is fighting - and as soon as a monster is revealed, the fight is on!\\nYou can discard a Class card at any time, even in combat: “I don't wanna be a wizard anymore.” When you discard a Class card, you become classless until you play another Class card.\\nYou may not belong to more than one class at once unless you play the Super Munchkin card.\\nRace: Characters may be Humans, Elves, Dwarves, or Halflings. If you have no Race card in front of you, you are human.\\n---\\n---\\nNAME: munchkin_rules/munchkin_rules-1.pdf\\nPAGE: 3\\nPASSAGE:\\nITEMS\\nMost Treasures are Items. Items have a Gold Piece value. “No Value” is equivalent to zero Gold Pieces, and a “No Value” card is considered an Item.\\nAll Items you have in play are considered “carried.” Items that are actually giving you a bonus are “equipped.” You should indicate Items that are not equipped by turning the cards sideways. You may not alter the status of your Items during a combat or while running away.\\nAnyone can carry any Item (except for extra Big items; see below), but you may equip only one Headgear, one suit of Armor, one pair of Footgear, and two “I Hand” Items (or one “2 Hands” Item) . . . unless you have a card that lets you ignore these limits, such as Hireling or Cheat!, or unless one of the cards says otherwise. If you are carrying two Headgear cards, for instance, you can equip only one of them at a time.\\nLikewise, some Items have restrictions: for instance, the Mace of Sharpness can only be wielded by a Cleric. Its bonus only counts for someone who is, at the moment, a Cleric.\\nYou cannot discard Item cards “just because.” You may sell Items for a level, trade Items with other players, or give an Item to another player who wants it (see below). You may discard Items to power certain Class and Race abilities. And a Curse or a monster's Bad Stuff (see p. 5) may force you to get rid of something!\\nBig Items: You may carry any number of Small items, but only one Big one. (Any item not marked Big is considered Small.) You may not discard one Big item to play another; you must sell the first Item, trade it, lose it to a Curse or Bad Stuff, or discard it to power a Class or Race ability.\\n---\\n---\\nNAME: munchkin_rules/munchkin_rules-1.pdf\\nPAGE: 2\\nPASSAGE:\\nSUPER MUNCHKIN AND HALF-BREED\\nThese cards may be played whenever it is legal to play a Class or Race, as long as you have an appropriate card (Class for Super Munchkin, Race for Half-Breed) to attach it to. You cannot have more than one of the same Class or Race card in play at once.\\nIf you play Super Munchkin with one Class, you get all the advantages of being that Class (the ability to equip Class-only Items, monsters with penalties against that Class suffer those penalties) and none of the disadvantages (you can equip Items forbidden to that Class, and monsters do not get bonuses because of your Class). If the Class has an ability that has a cost, however, you must still pay it - you aren't that Super! If you play Super Munchkin while you have two Classes, you have all the normal advantages and disadvantages of both Classes. (All of the above is also true for Half-Breed, just for Races.)\\n---\\n---\\nNAME: munchkin_rules/munchkin_rules-1.pdf\\nPAGE: 6\\nPASSAGE:\\nFaster Play Rules\\nFor a faster game, you can adda “phase 0” called Listen At The Door. At the start of your turn before doing anything else, draw a face-down Door card, which you may play or not. Then arrange cards and Kick Open The Door normally, If you Loot The Room, draw a face-down Treasure, not a Door.\\nUsually, a Curse affects its victim immediately (if it can) and is then discarded. However, some Curses give a penalty later in the game or have a continuing effect. Keep these cards until you get rid of the Curse or the penalty takes effect. (Curse cards you keep as a reminder may not be discarded to power Class or Race abilities. Nice try!) You can also allow shared victories — if a player reaches Level 10 in a fight where you are the helper, you also win the game, no matter what Note: If someone plays a “your next combat” Curse on you while you are Level you are.\\nin combat, it counts in that combat!

      "Most Treasures are Items. Items have a Gold Piece value. “No Value” is equivalent to zero Gold Pieces, and a “No Value” card is considered an Item.\n",
      "All Items you have in play are considered “carried.” Items that are actually giving you a bonus are “equipped.” You should indicate Items that are not equipped by turning the cards sideways. You may not alter the status of your Items during a combat or while running away.\n",
      "Anyone can carry any Item (except for extra Big items; see below), but you may equip only one Headgear, one suit of Armor, one pair of Footgear, and two “I Hand” Items (or one “2 Hands” Item) . . . unless you have a card that lets you ignore these limits, such as Hireling or Cheat!, or unless one of the cards says otherwise. If you are carrying two Headgear cards, for instance, you can equip only one of them at a time.\n",
      "Likewise, some Items have restrictions: for instance, the Mace of Sharpness can only be wielded by a Cleric. Its bonus only counts for someone who is, at the moment, a Cleric.\n",
      "You cannot discard Item cards “just because.” You may sell Items for a level, trade Items with other players, or give an Item to another player who wants it (see below). You may discard Items to power certain Class and Race abilities. And a Curse or a monster's Bad Stuff (see p. 5) may force you to get rid of something!\n",
      "Big Items: You may carry any number of Small items, but only one Big one. (Any item not marked Big is considered Small.) You may not discard one Big item to play another; you must sell the first Item, trade it, lose it to a Curse or Bad Stuff, or discard it to power a Class or Race ability.\n",

      "Steeds are Items, and follow normal Item rules. Anything that affects an Item can affect a Steed.\n",
      "Steeds carry themselves. A Steed is “Big,” but it does not count against the number of Big items you can carry (in fact, some let you carry more Big things). The “Big” designation on Steeds is to control what Traps and Curses affect them, and to keep Thieves from pocketing them and walking off.\n",
      "There are a few Items that specifically enhance Steeds. Steeds cannot use Items unless the Item card specifically says so, and Item Enhancers don’t affect Steed-enhancing Items.\n",
      "If a Steed has a bonus or penalty to Run Away, that replaces the bonus of the rider. An Elf normally has a bonus to Run Away, but he has a penalty if he is riding the Turtle Steed! If your Steed gives you a penalty to Run Away, you may discard the Steed before you roll to flee. You don’t suffer the penalty, but the card goes to the discard pile.\n",

      "Treating Steeds as Monsters\n",
      "A player who draws a face-up Steed may choose to treat it as a monster instead. In that case, its Level is equal to twice the combat bonus at the top of the card, and defeating it is good for one Treasure and one level. Monster Enhancers may be played on Steeds being fought as monsters, and have their normal effects. The Bad Stuff for any Steed attacked as a monster is “Lose a level.”\n",

Trading: You may trade Items (but no other cards) with other players. You may only trade Items from the table - not from your hand. You may trade at any time except when you or your trading partner are in combat — in fact, the best time to trade is when it’s not your turn, Any Ttem you receive in a trade must remain in play. You may also give Items away without a trade, to bribe other players - “Tl give you my Flaming Armor if you won't help Bob fight that dragon!” You may show your hand to others.

Selling Items for Levels: At any point during your turn except during combat or Running Away, you may discard Items worth a total of at least 1,000 Gold Pieces and immediately go up one level. (“No Value” cards are the same as zero Gold Pieces.) If you discard (for instance) 1,100 Gold Pieces worth, you don't get change.

If you cannot reduce your hand to five cards, or do not want to, you must give the excess cards to the player with the lowest Level. If players are tied for lowest, divide the cards as evenly as possible, but it's up to you who gets the bigger set(s) of leftovers.

You can play a Hireling at any time, even in combat, as long as you have only one Hireling in play at a time. If you draw a face-up Hireling, you may put it in your hand if you cannot (or don’t want to) put it in play. You may discard a Hireling at any time.\n",

You automatically escape from all monsters in the fight, even if a monster card says escape is impossible. If someone was helping you in the fight, YOU decide whether that person automatically escapes as well, or must roll to escape.\n",

For instance, you might describe your character as a “Level 8 Elf Wizard with Boots of Butt-Kicking, a Staff of Napalm, and the Kneepads of Allure.” Level: This is a measure of how generally buff and studly you are. When the rules or cards refer to your Level, capitalized, they mean this number. You gain a level when you kill a monster, or when a card says that you do. You can also sell Items to buy levels (see Items). You lose a level when a card says you do. Your Level can never go below 1. However, your combat strength can be negative, if you get hit by a Curse or suffer some other kind of penalty.\\nClass: Characters may be Warriors, Wizards, Thieves, or Clerics. If you have no Class card in front of you, you have no class. Yeah, I know, we did that one already.\\nEach Class has special abilities, shown on the cards. You gain the abilities of a Class the moment you play its card in front of you, and lose them as soon as you discard that card. Some Class abilities are powered by discards. You may discard any card, in play or in your hand, to power a special ability.\\nSee the Class cards for when abilities can be used. Note that a Thief cannot steal while he or the target is fighting - and as soon as a monster is revealed, the fight is on!\\nYou can discard a Class card at any time, even in combat: “I don't wanna be a wizard anymore.” When you discard a Class card, you become classless until you play another Class card.\\nYou may not belong to more than one class at once unless you play the Super Munchkin card.\",\n",

A Steed is “Big,” but it does not count against the number of Big items you can carry (in fact, some let you carry more Big things). The “Big” designation on Steeds is to control what Traps and Curses affect them, and to keep Thieves from pocketing them and walking off.\\nThere are a few Items that specifically enhance Steeds. Steeds cannot use Items unless the Item card specifically says so, and Item Enhancers don’t affect Steed-enhancing Items.\\nIf a Steed has a bonus or penalty to Run Away, that replaces the bonus of the rider. An Elf normally has a bonus to Run Away, but he has a penalty if he is riding the Turtle Steed! If your Steed gives you a penalty to Run Away, you may discard the Steed before you roll to flee. You don’t suffer the penalty, but the card goes to the discard pile.\\n\\nTreating Steeds as Monsters\\nA player who draws a face-up Steed may choose to treat it as a monster instead. In that case, its Level is equal to twice the combat bonus at the top of the card, and defeating it is good for one Treasure and one level.

Most of these are used during combat to strengthen the munchkins or the monsters, and may be played from your hand or from the table. Some have other effects, however, so read the card carefully! Discard these cards as soon as the combat is over or their effect is resolved.\\nOne-shot Items with a Gold Piece value may be sold for levels, just like other Items.\\n\\nOTHER TREASURES\\nOther Treasure cards (like Go Up a Level cards) are not Items. Most of these cards say when they can be played, and whether they stay in play or are discarded. A couple of specific examples: Go Upa Level cards may be played on yourself or any other player at any time, even during combat. Discard them once they are played.

For instance, you might describe your character as a “Level 8 Elf Wizard with Boots of Butt-Kicking, a Staff of Napalm, and the Kneepads of Allure.” Level: This is a measure of how generally buff and studly you are. When the rules or cards refer to your Level, capitalized, they mean this number. You gain a level when you kill a monster, or when a card says that you do. You can also sell Items to buy levels (see Items). You lose a level when a card says you do. Your Level can never go below 1. However, your combat strength can be negative, if you get hit by a Curse or suffer some other kind of penalty.\\nClass: Characters may be Warriors, Wizards, Thieves, or Clerics. If you have no Class card in front of you, you have no class. Yeah, I know, we did that one already.\\nEach Class has special abilities, shown on the cards. You gain the abilities of a Class the moment you play its card in front of you, and lose them as soon as you discard that card. Some Class abilities are powered by discards. You may discard any card, in play or in your hand, to power a special ability.\\nSee the Class cards for when abilities can be used. Note that a Thief cannot steal while he or the target is fighting - and as soon as a monster is revealed, the fight is on!\\nYou can discard a Class card at any time, even in combat: “I don't wanna be a wizard anymore.” When you discard a Class card, you become classless until you play another Class card.\\nYou may not belong to more than one class at once unless you play the Super Munchkin card.\\n---\\n\\n\\n---\\nNAME: munchkin_rules/munchkin_rules-1.pdf\\nPAGE: 4\\nPASSAGE:\\nInterfering With Combat\\nYou can interfere with others’ combats in several ways, including: Use a one-shot card. You could help another player by using a one-shot to strengthen their side. Of course, you can “accidentally” strengthen the monster with it, instead. . .\\nPlay a monster enhancer. These cards (usually) make a monster stronger .. . and give it more Treasure.

Each monster has a Treasure number on the bottom of its card. Draw that many Treasures, modified by any monster enhancers played on it. Draw face-down if you killed the monster alone. Draw face-up, so the whole party can see what you got, if someone helped you, even if they aren't taking any Treasures. (Sucker.)\\nIf you defeat a monster by nonlethal means, you do not get a level and you may or may not get the Treasure, depending on the method.\\nTreasure cards can be played as soon as you get them, even if you are the helper.\\n---\\n\\n\\n---\\nNAME: munchkin_rules/munch_4_rules_20thp.pdf\\nPAGE: 2\\nPASSAGE:\\nSTEEDS\\nDear to a munchkin’s heart (as of now) is his mighty Steed.

The context provides information about the rules and mechanics of the game \\\"Munchkin.\\\"\\n\\nTo answer the question, we need to follow the rules of the game and consider the specific circumstances of the situation. The rules state that a player may play a \\\"Go Up a Level\\\" card on themselves or any other player at any time, even during combat. However, if the player is in combat, the card must be discarded as soon as the combat is over or its effect is resolved.\\n\\nTherefore, if a player wants to play a \\\"Go Up a Level\\\" card during combat, they must ensure that they are not in combat when they discard the card or resolve its effect. If they are in combat, they must discard the card as soon as the combat is over or its effect is resolved.\\n\\nIn summary, a player can play a \\\"Go Up a Level\\\" card during combat, but they must ensure that they are not in combat when they discard or resolve the card's effect.\\n\\nTherefore, the answer is\"\n",

The player is asking if a specific card (a \\\"Go Up a Level\\\" card) can be played during combat.\\n2. The player is asking for guidance on how to walk through the context of the question in a manageable way.\\n3. The player is asking for information on how to summarize and analyze the context as they go.\\n\\nTo answer the question, we need to consider the rules of the game and the specific card in question.\\n\\nAccording to the rules of the game, a player can perform certain actions on their turn, including playing a card that they have just received. The \\\"Go Up a Level\\\" card is one type of card that can be played during a player's turn.\\n\\nHowever, it is not clear from the question whether the player is asking if they can play the \\\"Go Up a Level\\\" card during combat specifically, or if they can play any card during combat.\\n\\nIf the player is asking if they can play the \\\"Go Up a Level\\\" card during combat specifically, then the answer is no. According to the rules of the game, a player can go up a level after combat only if they have killed a monster. Therefore, during combat, a player cannot play a \\\"Go Up a Level\\\" card.\\n\\nIf the player is asking if they can play any card during combat, then the answer is yes. The rules of the game allow a player to play cards during their turn, and during combat, a player can choose to play a card if they wish.\\n\\nIn summary, the player can play the \\\"Go Up a Level\\\" card during their turn, but not during combat.

(Sucker.)\\nIf you defeat a monster by nonlethal means, you do not get a level and you may or may not get the Treasure, depending on the method.\\nTreasure cards can be played as soon as you get them, even if you are the helper.\\n---\\n\\n\\n---\\nNAME: munchkin_rules/munch_4_rules_20thp.pdf\\nPAGE: 2\\nPASSAGE:\\nSTEEDS\\nDear to a munchkin’s heart (as of now) is his mighty Steed. Because, of course, it gives bonuses. Steeds are found in the Door deck.\\nNo player can have more than one Steed except by using a Cheat! card.\\nSteeds are Items, and follow normal Item rules. Anything that affects an Item can affect a Steed.\\nSteeds carry themselves. A Steed is “Big,” but it does not count against the number of Big items you can carry (in fact, some let you carry more Big things). The “Big” designation on Steeds is to control what Traps and Curses affect them, and to keep Thieves from pocketing them and walking off.\\nThere are a few Items that specifically enhance Steeds. Steeds cannot use Items unless the Item card specifically says so, and Item Enhancers don’t affect Steed-enhancing Items.\\nIf a Steed has a bonus or penalty to Run Away, that replaces the bonus of the rider. An Elf normally has a bonus to Run Away, but he has a penalty if he is riding the Turtle Steed! If your Steed gives you a penalty to Run Away, you may discard the Steed before you roll to flee. You don’t suffer the penalty, but the card goes to the discard pile.\\n\\nTreating Steeds as Monsters\\nA player who draws a face-up Steed may choose to treat it as a monster instead. In that case, its Level is equal to twice the combat bonus at the top of the card, and defeating it is good for one Treasure and one level. Monster Enhancers may be played on Steeds being fought as monsters, and have their normal effects. The Bad Stuff for any Steed attacked as a monster is “Lose a level.”\\n---\\n\",\n",

For instance, you might describe your character as a “Level 8 Elf Wizard with Boots of Butt-Kicking, a Staff of Napalm, and the Kneepads of Allure.” Level: This is a measure of how generally buff and studly you are. When the rules or cards refer to your Level, capitalized, they mean this number. You gain a level when you kill a monster, or when a card says that you do. You can also sell Items to buy levels (see Items). You lose a level when a card says you do. Your Level can never go below 1. However, your combat strength can be negative, if you get hit by a Curse or suffer some other kind of penalty.\\nClass: Characters may be Warriors, Wizards, Thieves, or Clerics. If you have no Class card in front of you, you have no class. Yeah, I know, we did that one already.\\nEach Class has special abilities, shown on the cards. You gain the abilities of a Class the moment you play its card in front of you, and lose them as soon as you discard that card. Some Class abilities are powered by discards. You may discard any card, in play or in your hand, to power a special ability.\\nSee the Class cards for when abilities can be used. Note that a Thief cannot steal while he or the target is fighting - and as soon as a monster is revealed, the fight is on!\\nYou can discard a Class card at any time, even in combat: “I don't wanna be a wizard anymore.” When you discard a Class card, you become classless until you play another Class card.\\nYou may not belong to more than one class at once unless you play the Super Munchkin card.\",\n",

Many cards add special rules, so in most cases when the rulesheet disagrees with a card, follow the card. However, ignore any card effect that might seem to contradict one of the rules listed below unless the card explicitly says it supersedes that rule!\\niL Nothing can reduce a player below Level 1, although card effects might reduce a player's or a monster's combat strength (p. 3) below I.\\n2. You go up a level after combat only if you Ail a monster.\\n3. You cannot collect rewards for defeating a monster (eg., Treasure, levels) in the middle of a combat. You must finish the fight before gaining any rewards.\\n4. You must killa monster to reach Level 10, and you cannot force another player to help you do it.\\nAny other disputes should be settled by loud arguments, with the owner of the game having the last word. You could also read the Munchkin FAQ and errata pages at munchkin.game, or start a discussion at forums.sjgames.com/, munchkin . . . unless it’s more fun to argue.\\n\\nSTEVE JACKSON GAMES\\nYour Hand: Cards in your hand are not in play. They don’t help you, but they can’t be taken away except by cards that specifically affect “your hand.” At the end of your turn, you may have no more than five cards in your hand (see Charity, p- 2).\\nCards in play may not be returned to your hand - they must be discarded or traded if you want to get rid of them.\\n---\\n\\n\\n---\\nNAME: munchkin_rules/munchkin_rules-1.pdf\\nPAGE: 3\\nPASSAGE:\\n\\\"ONE-SHOT” TREASURES\\nA Treasure card that says “Usable once only” is often called a “one-shot” Treasure. Most of these are used during combat to strengthen the munchkins or the monsters, and may be played from your hand or from the table. Some have other effects, however, so read the card carefully! Discard these cards as soon as the combat is over or their effect is resolved.\\nOne-shot Items with a Gold Piece value may be sold for levels, just like other Items.\\n\\nOTHER TREASURES\\nOther Treasure cards (like Go Up a Level cards) are not Items. Most of these cards say when they can be played, and whether they stay in play or are discarded. A couple of specific examples: Go Upa Level cards may be played on yourself or any other player at any time, even during combat. Discard them once they are played. Exception: You cannot play a Go Up a Level card to give a player the winning level!\\nHireling may be played at any time, on any turn.
