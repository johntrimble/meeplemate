A Steed is \u201cBig,\u201d but it does not count against the number of Big items you can carry (in fact, some let you carry more Big things). The \u201cBig\u201d designation on Steeds is to control what Traps and Curses affect them, and to keep Thieves from pocketing them and walking off.\nThere are a few Items that specifically enhance Steeds. Steeds cannot use Items unless the Item card specifically says so, and Item Enhancers don\u2019t affect Steed-enhancing Items.\nIf a Steed has a bonus or penalty to Run Away, that replaces the bonus of the rider. An Elf normally has a bonus to Run Away, but he has a penalty if he is riding the Turtle Steed! If your Steed gives you a penalty to Run Away, you may discard the Steed before you roll to flee.

Ifhe refuses, you may ask another player, and so on, until they all turn you down or someone helps. Only one player can help you, adding their combat strength to yours. Anyone can play cards to affect your combat, however!\nYou'll probably have to bribe someone to help. You may offer your helper any Item(s) you are currently carrying, or any number of the Treasure cards the monster has. If you offer part of the monster's Treasure, you must agree whether they pick first, or you pick first, or whatever. You may also offer to play any cards from your hand that you legally could, such as Go Up a Level cards, on your helper.\nThe special abilities or vulnerabilities of the monster also apply to your helper, and vice versa. For instance, if a Warrior helps you, you will win if your combined total ties that of the monster, and your helper can Berserk and discard cards to add their his combat strength (but only once per combat, not once per monster). If you are facing the Wannabe Vampire and a Cleric helps you, they can chase it away automatically. But if you are facing the Drooling Slime and an Elf helps you, the monster's combat strength is increased by 4 (unless you, too, are an Elf and the monster's combat strength has already been increased).\nIf someone successfully helps you kill the monster, discard it, draw Treasures (see Rewards, below), and follow any special instructions on the monster card. You level up for each slain monster. Your helper does not go up any levels . . . unless the helper is an Elf, in which case they gain one level for each monster slain.

Combat strength is the total of Level plus all modifiers - positive or negative - given by Items and other cards. If the monster's combat strength is equal to yours, or greater, you lose the combat and must Run Away (see p. 5). If your combat strength totals more than the monster's \u2014 note that monsters win ties! \u2014 you kill it and goupa level (two levels for some big monsters). You'll also get the number of Treasures shown on its card.\nSometimes a card will let you get rid of the monster without killing it. This is still \u201cwinning,\u201d but you don't get a level. Unless the ability says otherwise, you don\u2019t get the Treasures, either.

Be sure to check these!\nYou and the other players may play one-shot Treasures or use Class or Race abilities to help or harm you in your combat. Some Door cards may also be played into a combat, such as monster enhancers (see below).\nIf you kill a monster (or monsters!), discard the monster(s) and any other cards played, and claim your rewards. But note: someone may play a hostile card on you, or use a special power, just as you think you have won. When you kill a monster, you must wait a reasonable time, defined as about 2.6 seconds, for anyone else to speak up.

These cards (usually) make a monster stronger .. . and give it more Treasure. You can play these either during your own combats or during someone else's combat.\nAdd a monster from your hand to join the combat, either with a Wandering Monster card or by using the special Undead rule.\nBackstab a player in combat, if you're a Thief.\nCurse them, if you have a Curse card.\n\nREWARDS\nWhen you kill a monster, you get one level per monster, unless the monster card says something else, and you get all its Treasure! Each monster has a Treasure number on the bottom of its card. Draw that many Treasures, modified by any monster enhancers played on it. Draw face-down if you killed the monster alone. Draw face-up, so the whole party can see what you got, if someone helped you, even if they aren't taking any Treasures.

Anything that affects an Item can affect a Steed.\nSteeds carry themselves. A Steed is \u201cBig,\u201d but it does not count against the number of Big items you can carry (in fact, some let you carry more Big things). The \u201cBig\u201d designation on Steeds is to control what Traps and Curses affect them, and to keep Thieves from pocketing them and walking off.\nThere are a few Items that specifically enhance Steeds. Steeds cannot use Items unless the Item card specifically says so, and Item Enhancers don\u2019t affect Steed-enhancing Items.\nIf a Steed has a bonus or penalty to Run Away, that replaces the bonus of the rider. An Elf normally has a bonus to Run Away, but he has a penalty if he is riding the Turtle Steed! If your Steed gives you a penalty to Run Away, you may discard the Steed before you roll to flee. You don\u2019t suffer the penalty, but the card goes to the discard pile.\n\nTreating Steeds as Monsters\nA player who draws a face-up Steed may choose to treat it as a monster instead. In that case, its Level is equal to twice the combat bonus at the top of the card, and defeating it is good for one Treasure and one level.

For instance, you might describe your character as a \u201cLevel 8 Elf Wizard with Boots of Butt-Kicking, a Staff of Napalm, and the Kneepads of Allure.\u201d Level: This is a measure of how generally buff and studly you are. When the rules or cards refer to your Level, capitalized, they mean this number. You gain a level when you kill a monster, or when a card says that you do. You can also sell Items to buy levels (see Items). You lose a level when a card says you do. Your Level can never go below 1. However, your combat strength can be negative, if you get hit by a Curse or suffer some other kind of penalty.\nClass: Characters may be Warriors, Wizards, Thieves, or Clerics. If you have no Class card in front of you, you have no class. Yeah, I know, we did that one already.\nEach Class has special abilities, shown on the cards. You gain the abilities of a Class the moment you play its card in front of you, and lose them as soon as you discard that card. Some Class abilities are powered by discards. You may discard any card, in play or in your hand, to power a special ability.\nSee the Class cards for when abilities can be used. Note that a Thief cannot steal while he or the target is fighting - and as soon as a monster is revealed, the fight is on!\nYou can discard a Class card at any time, even in combat: \u201cI don't wanna be a wizard anymore.\u201d When you discard a Class card, you become classless until you play another Class card.\nYou may not belong to more than one class at once unless you play the Super Munchkin card.\n---\n---\nNAME: munchkin_rules/munchkin_rules-1.pdf\nPAGE: 2\nPASSAGE:\nSUPER MUNCHKIN AND HALF-BREED\nThese cards may be played whenever it is legal to play a Class or Race, as long as you have an appropriate card (Class for Super Munchkin, Race for Half-Breed) to attach it to.

Discard these cards as soon as the combat is over or their effect is resolved.\nOne-shot Items with a Gold Piece value may be sold for levels, just like other Items.\n\nOTHER TREASURES\nOther Treasure cards (like Go Up a Level cards) are not Items. Most of these cards say when they can be played, and whether they stay in play or are discarded. A couple of specific examples: Go Upa Level cards may be played on yourself or any other player at any time, even during combat. Discard them once they are played. Exception: You cannot play a Go Up a Level card to give a player the winning level!\nHireling may be played at any time, on any turn. You cannot give a Hireling an Item to carry while you are in combat, however.\n---\n---\nNAME: munchkin_rules/munchkin_rules-1.pdf\nPAGE: 5\nPASSAGE:\nDEATH\nIf you die, you lose all your stuff. You keep your Class(es), Race(s), and Level (and any Curses that were affecting you when you died) - your new character will look just like your old one. If you have Half-Breed or Super Munchkin, keep those as well.\nOnce you have died, you don\u2019t have to Run Away from any remaining monsters.\nLooting The Body: Lay out your hand beside the cards you had in play (making sure not to include the cards mentioned above). If you have an Item carried bya Hireling or attached to a Cheat! card, separate those cards. Starting with the player with the highest Level, everyone else chooses one card . . . in case of ties in Level, roll a die. Once everyone gets one card, discard the rest. If your corpse runs out of cards, tough. Looted cards go into players\u2019 hands.\nDead characters cannot receive cards for any reason, not even Charity, and cannot level up or win the game.\nWhen the next player begins their turn, your newly revived character appears and can help others in combat with your Level and Class or Race abilities . . . but you have no cards, unless you receive Charity or gifts from other players.\nOn your next turn, start by drawing four face-down cards from each deck and playing any legal cards you want to, just as when you started the game. Then take your turn normally.\n---"}, {"query": "Can I play a Curse while in combat?", "answer": "Yes. A curse may be played at any time.", "result": "Based on the provided excerpts, it's unclear if you can play a Curse during combat.

At the start of your turn before doing anything else, draw a face-down Door card, which you may play or not. Then arrange cards and Kick Open The Door normally, If you Loot The Room, draw a face-down Treasure, not a Door.\nUsually, a Curse affects its victim immediately (if it can) and is then discarded. However, some Curses give a penalty later in the game or have a continuing effect. Keep these cards until you get rid of the Curse or the penalty takes effect. (Curse cards you keep as a reminder may not be discarded to power Class or Race abilities. Nice try!) You can also allow shared victories \u2014 if a player reaches Level 10 in a fight where you are the helper, you also win the game, no matter what Note: If someone plays a \u201cyour next combat\u201d Curse on you while you are Level you are.\nin combat, it counts in that combat! The same is true for a \u201cyour next turn\u201d Curse played during your turn.\nGame Design by Steve Jackson @ Illustrated by John Kovalic President/Editor-in-Chief: Steve Jackson @ Chief Executive Officer: Philip Reed @ Chief Operating Officer: Susan Bueno @ Chief Creative Officer: Sam Mitschke Munchkin Line Editor: Andrew Hackard @ Production Manager: Sabrina Gonzalez @ Production Artists: Alex Fernandez and Sabrina Gonzalez Project Manager: Darryll Silva @ Operations Manager: Randy Scheunemann @ Director of Sales: Ross Jepson Playtesters: Steve Brinich, Moe Chapman, Paul Chapman, Alain Dawson, Jessie D.

If acquired some other way, such as by Looting The Room, Curse cards go into your hand and may be played on any player at any time. Reducing someone's abilities just as they think they have killed a monster is a lot of fun.\nIf a Curse can apply to more than one Item, the victim decides which Item is lost & or Cursed. OO Ifa Curse applies to something you don't have, ignore it. For instance, if you draw Lose Your Armor and you have no Armor, nothing happens; discard the card.

When the rules or cards refer to your Level, capitalized, they mean this number. You gain a level when you kill a monster, or when a card says that you do. You can also sell Items to buy levels (see Items). You lose a level when a card says you do. Your Level can never go below 1. However, your combat strength can be negative, if you get hit by a Curse or suffer some other kind of penalty.\nClass: Characters may be Warriors, Wizards, Thieves, or Clerics.

Items have a Gold Piece value. \u201cNo Value\u201d is equivalent to zero Gold Pieces, and a \u201cNo Value\u201d card is considered an Item.\nAll Items you have in play are considered \u201ccarried.\u201d Items that are actually giving you a bonus are \u201cequipped.\u201d You should indicate Items that are not equipped by turning the cards sideways. You may not alter the status of your Items during a combat or while running away.\nAnyone can carry any Item (except for extra Big items; see below), but you may equip only one Headgear, one suit of Armor, one pair of Footgear, and two \u201cI Hand\u201d Items (or one \u201c2 Hands\u201d Item) . . . unless you have a card that lets you ignore these limits, such as Hireling or Cheat!, or unless one of the cards says otherwise. If you are carrying two Headgear cards, for instance, you can equip only one of them at a time.\nLikewise, some Items have restrictions: for instance, the Mace of Sharpness can only be wielded by a Cleric. Its bonus only counts for someone who is, at the moment, a Cleric.\nYou cannot discard Item cards \u201cjust because.\u201d You may sell Items for a level, trade Items with other players, or give an Item to another player who wants it (see below). You may discard Items to power certain Class and Race abilities. And a Curse or a monster's Bad Stuff (see p. 5) may force you to get rid of something!\nBig Items: You may carry any number of Small items, but only one Big one. (Any item not marked Big is considered Small.) You may not discard one Big item to play another; you must sell the first Item, trade it, lose it to a Curse or Bad Stuff, or discard it to power a Class or Race ability.\n---"}]
