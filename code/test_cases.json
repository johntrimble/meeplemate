Many cards introduce special rules, so in most cases when the rulesheet contradicts a card, follow the card. However, disregard any card effect that seems to contradict one of the rules listed below unless the card explicitly states that it supersedes that rule.\n\n1. No card can reduce a player below Level 1, although a card may reduce a player's or a monster's combat strength (p. 3) below Level 1.\n2. You go up a level after combat only if you defeat a monster.\n3. You cannot collect rewards for defeating a monster (e.g., Treasure, levels) during combat. You must complete the fight before gaining any rewards.\n4. You must kill a monster to reach Level 10, and you cannot force another player to help you do it.\n\nFor any other disputes, settle them through loud arguments, with the owner of the game having the final say.

They don't help you, but they can't be taken away except by cards that specifically affect \"your hand.\" At the end of your turn, you may have no more than five cards in your hand (see Charity, p- 2).\n\nCards in play may not be returned to your hand - they must be discarded or traded if you want to get rid of them.\n---\n---\nNAME: munchkin_rules/munchkin_rules-1.pdf\nPAGE: 4\nPASSAGE:\nInterfering with Combat\n\nThere are several ways to interfere with others' combats, such as:\n\n1. Use a one-shot card: You can help another player by using a one-shot to strengthen their side, or \"accidentally\" strengthen the monster instead.\n2. Play a monster enhancer: These cards (usually) make a monster stronger and give it more Treasure. You can play these either during your own combats or during someone else's combat.\n3. Add a monster from your hand to join the combat: You can do this with a Wandering Monster card or by using the special Undead rule.\n4. Backstab a player in combat, if you're a Thief.\n5. Curse them, if you have a Curse card.\n\nREWARDS\n\nWhen you kill a monster, you gain one level per monster, unless the monster card states otherwise, and you get all its Treasure! Each monster has a Treasure number on the bottom of its card. Draw that many Treasures, modified by any monster enhancers played on it.\n\n1. Draw face-down if you killed the monster alone.\n2. Draw face-up, so the whole party can see what you got, if someone helped you, even if they aren't taking any Treasures (Sucker).\n\nIf you defeat a monster by nonlethal means, you do not gain a level and may or may not get the Treasure, depending on the method.\n\nTreasure cards can be played as soon as you get them, even if you are the helper.\n---\n---\nNAME: munchkin_rules/munchkin_rules-1.pdf\nPAGE: 5\nPASSAGE:\nContext:\n>>>\nSuzan: Not the Yuppie Water! Noooo oe\nAric: That's +3 to me, and now we're tied, 15 to 15. Because I\u2019m a Warrior, I win ties... so I\u2019m killing the Net Troll unless someone else plans to mess with me. Anyone?\nNo one responds, so Aric advances a level and claims the Net Troll's treasures - three from the Net Troll card, and one extra because it was Enraged. And the game continues...\n\nRUNNING AWAY\nIf nobody is willing to assist you... or if someone tries to help, but your fellow adventurers interfere, resulting in both of you still unable to win... you must retreat. You don't gain any levels or Treasure. You don't even get to Loot the Room. And you don't always escape unscathed...\nRoll the die. You escape on a 5 or more. Some Class and Race abilities and some Treasures make it easier or harder to Retreat from all monsters. And some monsters give you a bonus or penalty to your roll for that monster only.\nIf you fail to Retreat from a monster, it inflicts Bad Stuff upon you, as described on its card. This may vary from losing an Item, to losing one or more levels, to Death (see below).\nIf you are fleeing from multiple monsters, you roll separately to escape each one, in any order you choose, and suffer Bad Stuff from each one that catches you as soon as it catches you.\nIf two players are cooperating and still can't defeat the monster(s), they must both Retreat. They roll separately for each monster, in whatever order they like. (If they can't decide, roll the die; the high roller decides who Retreats first.) The monster(s) CAN catch them both.\nOnce you have resolved all Retreat rolls, discard the monster(s).\n---\n---\nNAME: munchkin_rules/munchkin_rules-1.pdf\nPAGE: 3\nPASSAGE:\nCombat\nTo engage in combat with a monster, compare its combat strength to yours. Combat strength is the sum of your Level and all positive or negative modifiers from Items and other cards. If the monster's combat strength is equal to or greater than yours, you lose the combat and must Run Away (see page 5). If your combat strength exceeds the monster's (remember, monsters win ties!), you defeat it and gain a level (two levels for some larger monsters). You'll also receive the number of Treasures shown on its card.\n\nSometimes, a card may allow you to eliminate the monster without defeating it. This is still considered a victory, but you won't gain a level. Unless the ability states otherwise, you won't receive the Treasures either. If the last monster is removed from combat, the combat ends immediately.\n\nSome monster cards have special abilities that affect combat, such as bonuses against a specific Race or Class. Make sure to check these!\n\nYou and the other players may use one-shot Treasures, Class or Race abilities, or play Door cards to assist or hinder you in combat.\n\nIf you defeat a monster (or monsters!), discard the monster(s) and any other cards played, and claim your rewards. However, be prepared for someone to play a hostile card on you or use a special power just as you think you have won. When you defeat a monster, you must wait a reasonable time (approximately 2.6 seconds) for others to speak up. After that, you have truly defeated the monster, and you truly gain the levels and Treasures, although they can still complain and argue.\n---"}, {"query": "Can I sell items from my hand to go up a level, assuming I can sell 1,000 gold pieces worth?", "answer": "Yes.

You can go up multiple levels at once by discarding items worth 2,000 gold pieces, for example. However, you cannot use this method to reach Level 10.\n\n2.

If they refuse, you may ask another player, and so on, until they all turn you down or someone helps. Only one player can help you, adding their combat strength to yours. Anyone can play cards to affect your combat, however!\n\nYou will likely have to bribe someone to help you. You may offer your helper any items you are currently carrying, or any number of the treasure cards the monster has. If you offer part of the monster's treasure, you must agree whether they pick first, or you pick first, or whatever. You may also offer to play any cards from your hand that you legally could, such as Go Up a Level cards, on your helper.\n\nThe special abilities or vulnerabilities of the monster also apply to your helper, and vice versa. For instance, if a Warrior helps you, you will win if your combined total ties that of the monster, and your helper can Berserk and discard cards to add their combat strength (but only once per combat, not once per monster). If you are facing the Wannabe Vampire and a Cleric helps you, they can chase it away automatically. But if you are facing the Drooling Slime and an Elf helps you, the monster's combat strength is increased by 4 (unless you, too, are an Elf and the monster's combat strength has already been increased).\n\nIf someone successfully helps you kill the monster, discard it, draw treasures (see Rewards, below), and follow any special instructions on the monster card. You level up for each slain monster. Your helper does not go up any levels, unless they are an Elf, in which case they gain one level for each monster slain. You draw the treasure cards, even if it was your helper's special ability that defeated the monster, and distribute them according to the agreement you reached.\n---"}, {"query": "Can I play a Go Up a Level card during combat on my turn?", "answer": "Yes.

(See Fighting Multiple Monsters, below.)\n\nEach monster card represents a single monster, even if the name on the card is plural.\n\n# MONSTER ENHANCERS\nCertain cards, called monster enhancers, can increase or decrease the combat strength of individual monsters. (Penalties to monsters are still considered enhancers.) They also affect the number of Treasures the monsters are worth. Monster enhancers can be played by any player during any combat.\n\nAll enhancers on a single monster add together. If there are multiple monsters in a combat, the player who plays each enhancer must choose which monster it applies to.\n\nException: Anything that enhances a monster also enhances its Mate. If Ancient, Enraged, and Mate are played on a single monster, in any order, you are facing an Ancient Enraged monster and its Ancient Enraged Mate.\n\n# FIGHTING MULTIPLE MONSTERS\nSome cards, such as Wandering Monster, allow your rivals to send other monsters to join the fight. You must defeat their combined combat strengths. Any special abilities, such as forcing you to fight with your Level only, apply to the entire fight. If you have the right cards, you can eliminate one monster from the combat and fight the other(s) normally, but you cannot choose to fight one and Run Away from the other(s). If you eliminate one monster, but then run from the other(s), you don't get any levels or Treasure!\n---\n---\nNAME: munchkin_rules/munchkin_rules-1.pdf\nPAGE: 3\nPASSAGE:\n**ONE-SHOT TREASURES**\n\nA Treasure card with the text \"Usable once only\" is often referred to as a \"one-shot\" Treasure. These are typically used during combat to boost the munchkins or the monsters, and can be played from your hand or from the table. Some have other effects, so make sure to read the card carefully! Discard these cards as soon as the combat is over or their effect is resolved.\n\nOne-shot Items with a Gold Piece value can be sold for levels, just like other Items.\n\n**OTHER TREASURES**\n\nOther Treasure cards (like Go Up a Level cards) are not Items. Most of these cards specify when they can be played and whether they stay in play or are discarded. A couple of specific examples:\n\n- Go Up a Level cards can be played on yourself or any other player at any time, even during combat. Discard them once they are played. Note that you cannot play a Go Up a Level card to give a player the winning level!\n- Hireling can be played at any time, on any turn. However, you cannot give a Hireling an Item to carry while you are in combat.\n---\n---\nNAME: munchkin_rules/munchkin_rules-1.pdf\nPAGE: 4\nPASSAGE:\nInterfering with Combat\n\nThere are several ways to interfere with others' combats, such as:\n\n1. Use a one-shot card: You can help another player by using a one-shot to strengthen their side, or \"accidentally\" strengthen the monster instead.\n2. Play a monster enhancer: These cards (usually) make a monster stronger and give it more Treasure. You can play these either during your own combats or during someone else's combat.\n3. Add a monster from your hand to join the combat: You can do this with a Wandering Monster card or by using the special Undead rule.\n4. Backstab a player in combat, if you're a Thief.\n5. Curse them, if you have a Curse card.\n\nREWARDS\n\nWhen you kill a monster, you gain one level per monster, unless the monster card states otherwise, and you get all its Treasure! Each monster has a Treasure number on the bottom of its card. Draw that many Treasures, modified by any monster enhancers played on it.\n\n1. Draw face-down if you killed the monster alone.\n2. Draw face-up, so the whole party can see what you got, if someone helped you, even if they aren't taking any Treasures (Sucker).\n\nIf you defeat a monster by nonlethal means, you do not gain a level and may or may not get the Treasure, depending on the method.\n\nTreasure cards can be played as soon as you get them, even if you are the helper.\n---"}, {"query": "How many players can join me in a combat?", "answer": "Only one player can join you in combat.", "result": "In Munchkin, up to 6 players can join a combat. To get help, a player can ask other players until they get help or everyone refuses. The helper and the player being helped can use their combined combat strength to defeat the monster. The helper will not gain levels but will receive treasure cards, while the player being helped will gain levels and treasure cards. Players can use various cards to interfere with other players' combats. When a monster is defeated, the player who dealt the final blow gains treasure cards and levels, while helpers gain treasure cards but not levels.", "context": "---\nNAME: munchkin_rules/munchkin_rules-1.pdf\nPAGE: 4\nPASSAGE:\nAsking for Help\n\nIf you cannot win a combat on your own, you may ask another player to help you. If they refuse, you may ask another player, and so on, until they all turn you down or someone helps. Only one player can help you, adding their combat strength to yours. Anyone can play cards to affect your combat, however!\n\nYou will likely have to bribe someone to help you. You may offer your helper any items you are currently carrying, or any number of the treasure cards the monster has. If you offer part of the monster's treasure, you must agree whether they pick first, or you pick first, or whatever. You may also offer to play any cards from your hand that you legally could, such as Go Up a Level cards, on your helper.\n\nThe special abilities or vulnerabilities of the monster also apply to your helper, and vice versa. For instance, if a Warrior helps you, you will win if your combined total ties that of the monster, and your helper can Berserk and discard cards to add their combat strength (but only once per combat, not once per monster). If you are facing the Wannabe Vampire and a Cleric helps you, they can chase it away automatically. But if you are facing the Drooling Slime and an Elf helps you, the monster's combat strength is increased by 4 (unless you, too, are an Elf and the monster's combat strength has already been increased).\n\nIf someone successfully helps you kill the monster, discard it, draw treasures (see Rewards, below), and follow any special instructions on the monster card. You level up for each slain monster. Your helper does not go up any levels, unless they are an Elf, in which case they gain one level for each monster slain. You draw the treasure cards, even if it was your helper's special ability that defeated the monster, and distribute them according to the agreement you reached.\n---\n---\nNAME: munchkin_rules/munchkin_rules-1.pdf\nPAGE: 3\nPASSAGE:\nCombat\nTo engage in combat with a monster, compare its combat strength to yours. Combat strength is calculated by adding your Level and all positive or negative modifiers from Items and other cards. If the monster's combat strength is equal to or greater than yours, you lose the combat and must Run Away (see page 5). If your combat strength surpasses the monster's (remember, monsters win ties!), you defeat it and gain a level (two levels for some larger monsters). You'll also receive the number of Treasures shown on its card.\n\nSometimes, a card may allow you to eliminate the monster without defeating it. This is still considered a victory, but you won't gain a level. Unless the ability states otherwise, you won't receive the Treasures either. If the last monster is removed from combat, the combat ends immediately.\n\nSome monster cards have special abilities that affect combat, such as bonuses against a specific Race or Class. Make sure to check these!\n\nDuring combat, you and other players can use one-shot Treasures, Class or Race abilities, or even certain Door cards to assist or hinder you in the combat.\n\nUpon defeating a monster (or monsters!), discard the monster(s) and any other cards played, and claim your rewards. However, be prepared for someone to play a hostile card on you or use a special power just as you think you have won. When you defeat a monster, give a reasonable waiting time (approximately 2.6 seconds) for others to speak up. After that, you have truly defeated the monster, and you truly gain the levels and Treasures, although they can still complain and argue.\n---\n---\nNAME: munchkin_rules/munchkin_rules-1.pdf\nPAGE: 4\nPASSAGE:\nIn Munchkin, certain cards or abilities enable you to coerce another player into assisting you in combat. However, these abilities are ineffective when fighting for the victory. If you compel someone to aid you and the fight becomes a win-or-lose scenario, they are exempt from any penalties and can withdraw without consequences. Conversely, if you willingly help someone, you cannot withdraw simply because they are on the verge of winning the game; thus, it is crucial to remain vigilant.\n---\n---\nNAME: munchkin_rules/munchkin_rules-1.pdf\nPAGE: 1\nPASSAGE:\nMunchkin brings you the essence of the dungeon-crawling experience without all that messy roleplaying! This game includes 168 cards, one six-sided die, and these rules. Three to six players can enjoy the game. You will need 10 tokens (coins, poker chips, or any gadget that counts to 10) for each player.\n\nSETUP\nDivide the cards into the Door deck and the Treasure deck. Shuffle both decks. Deal four cards from each deck to each player.\n\nCARD MANAGEMENT\nKeep separate face-up discard piles for the two decks. You may not look through the discards unless you play a card that allows you to! When a deck runs out, reshuffle its discards.\nIn Play: These are the cards on the table in front of you, showing your Race and Class (if any) and the Items you are carrying.

If you have a Princess card, are not already a Princess, and want to become a Princess, just play it in front of you. Keep the Princess card as long as you want, even if you die. You may discard Princess at any time.\n---\n---\nNAME: munchkin_rules/munchkin_rules-1.pdf\nPAGE: 5\nPASSAGE:\nIn the game of Munchkin, when a player dies, they lose all their in-game items, but retain their Class(es), Race(s), Level, Curses, Half-Breed, and Super Munchkin status. Their new character will have the same attributes as the old one. Once a player has died, they do not need to Run Away from any remaining monsters.\n\nLooting the Body: Players lay out their hand beside the cards they had in play, excluding the cards mentioned above. If a player has an Item carried by a Hireling or attached to a Cheat! card, they separate those cards. Starting with the player with the highest Level, each player chooses one card. In case of ties in Level, a die roll determines the order. Once everyone has chosen a card, the remaining cards are discarded. If a corpse runs out of cards, it's too bad. Looted cards go into players' hands.\n\nDead characters cannot receive cards for any reason, not even Charity, and cannot level up or win the game. When the next player begins their turn, the newly revived character appears and can help others in combat with their Level and Class or Race abilities, but they have no cards unless they receive Charity or gifts from other players.\n\nOn the revived player's next turn, they start by drawing four face-down cards from each deck and playing any legal cards they want to, just as when they started the game. Then they take their turn normally.\n---\n---\nNAME: munchkin_rules/munchkin_rules-1.pdf\nPAGE: 3\nPASSAGE:\n**ONE-SHOT TREASURES**\n\nA Treasure card with the text \"Usable once only\" is often referred to as a \"one-shot\" Treasure. These are typically used during combat to boost the munchkins or the monsters, and can be played from your hand or from the table. Some have other effects, so make sure to read the card carefully! Discard these cards as soon as the combat is over or their effect is resolved.\n\nOne-shot Items with a Gold Piece value can be sold for levels, just like other Items.\n\n**OTHER TREASURES**\n\nOther Treasure cards (like Go Up a Level cards) are not Items. Most of these cards specify when they can be played and whether they stay in play or are discarded. A couple of specific examples:\n\n- Go Up a Level cards can be played on yourself or any other player at any time, even during combat. Discard them once they are played. Note that you cannot play a Go Up a Level card to give a player the winning level!\n- Hireling can be played at any time, on any turn. However, you cannot give a Hireling an Item to carry while you are in combat.\n---\n---\nNAME: munchkin_rules/munchkin_rules-1.pdf\nPAGE: 2\nPASSAGE:\n# CHARACTER STATS\nEach character is defined by their weapons, armor, and magic items, with three main stats: Level, Race, and Class. For example, you might describe your character as a \"Level 8 Elf Wizard with Boots of Butt-Kicking, a Staff of Napalm, and the Kneepads of Allure.\"\n\n## Level\nThis stat represents your overall strength and prowess. When the rules or cards refer to your Level (capitalized), they mean this number. You gain a level when you defeat a monster or when a card instructs you to do so. You can also purchase levels by selling items (see Items). You can lose a level when a card states that you must do so. Your Level can never be less than 1, but your combat strength can be negative if you are cursed or suffer other penalties.\n\n## Class\nCharacters can be Warriors, Wizards, Thieves, or Clerics. If you have no Class card in front of you, you have no class.\n\nEach Class has unique abilities, which are activated when you play the corresponding card. You gain these abilities as soon as you play the card and lose them when you discard it. Some Class abilities require discards to activate. You may discard any card, whether in play or in your hand, to power a special ability.\n\nRefer to the Class cards for information on when abilities can be used. Note that a Thief cannot steal while fighting or when the target is fighting, and as soon as a monster is revealed, the fight begins.\n\nYou can discard a Class card at any time, even during combat: \"I don't want to be a wizard anymore.\" When you discard a Class card, you become classless until you play another Class card.\n\nYou may not belong to more than one class at a time unless you play the Super Munchkin card.\n\n## Race\nCharacters can be Humans, Elves, Dwarves, or Halflings. If you have no Race card in front of you, you are human.\n---\n---\nNAME: munchkin_rules/munchkin_rules-1.pdf\nPAGE: 3\nPASSAGE:\n**Treasures**\n\nTreasure cards consist of permanent and \"one-shot\" cards. You can play any Treasure card on the table as soon as you acquire it, or during your turn, excluding combat (unless the rules or the card itself specify otherwise).\n---"}, {"query": "Can I carry multiple big items so long as only one is equipped?", "answer": "No. You can only carry one big item at a time.", "result": "A: Yes, you can carry multiple big items as long as only one is equipped.", "context": "---\nNAME: munchkin_rules/munchkin_rules-1.pdf\nPAGE: 3\nPASSAGE:\nItems are the most common Treasures in Munchkin. They have a Gold Piece value, and a \"No Value\" card is equivalent to zero Gold Pieces. Items that are \"carried\" are considered to be in your possession, while those that are providing you with a bonus are \"equipped.\" To indicate that an Item is not equipped, turn the card sideways. You cannot alter the status of your Items during combat or while running away.\n\nAny player can carry any Item (except for extra Big items; see below), but you may equip only one Headgear, one suit of Armor, one pair of Footgear, and two \"I Hand\" Items (or one \"2 Hands\" Item) . . . unless you have a card that lets you ignore these limits, such as Hireling or Cheat!, or unless one of the cards says otherwise. If you are carrying two Headgear cards, for instance, you can equip only one of them at a time.\n\nSome Items have restrictions, such as the Mace of Sharpness, which can only be wielded by a Cleric. Its bonus only counts for someone who is, at the moment, a Cleric.\n\nYou cannot discard Item cards \"just because.\" You may sell Items for a level, trade Items with other players, or give an Item to another player who wants it (see below). You may discard Items to power certain Class and Race abilities. And a Curse or a monster's Bad Stuff (see p. 5) may force you to get rid of something!\n\nBig Items: You may carry any number of Small items, but only one Big one. (Any item not marked Big is considered Small.) You may not discard one Big item to play another; you must sell the first Item, trade it, lose it to a Curse or Bad Stuff, or discard it to power a Class or Race ability.\n---\n---\nNAME: munchkin_rules/munch_4_rules_20thp.pdf\nPAGE: 2\nPASSAGE:\nSteeds are a beloved item in the game of Munchkin, providing bonuses to players. They can be found in the Door deck and are subject to normal Item rules. A player cannot possess more than one Steed, except through the use of a Cheat! card. Steeds are considered \"Big\" items, but do not count against the number of Big items a player can carry. The \"Big\" designation is used to control which Traps and Curses affect them and to prevent Thieves from pocketing them.\n\nThere are specific Items that enhance Steeds, and Steeds themselves cannot use Items unless the Item card explicitly states so. Item Enhancers do not affect Steed-enhancing Items. If a Steed provides a bonus or penalty to Run Away, it replaces the rider's bonus. A player can discard the Steed before rolling to flee, avoiding the penalty but sending the card to the discard pile.\n\nA player who draws a face-up Steed can choose to treat it as a monster instead. In this case, its Level is equal to twice the combat bonus at the top of the card, and defeating it grants one Treasure and one level. Monster Enhancers can be played on Steeds being fought as monsters, with their normal effects. If a Steed is attacked as a monster, the consequence is \"Lose a level.\"\n---\n---\nNAME: munchkin_rules/munchkin_rules-1.pdf\nPAGE: 3\nPASSAGE:\nIn Munchkin, if you have more than one Big item due to a certain ability (e.g., the Dwarf race) and you lose that ability, you must either fix the issue immediately or discard all but one Big item.

If there are still big items left over, discard them.\n\n## Trading Items\n\nYou can trade items with other players, but not other cards. You can only trade items from the table, not from your hand. The best time to trade is when it's not your turn.\n\nAny item you receive in a trade must remain in play. You can also give items away without a trade, as a bribe to other players.\n\n## Selling Items for Levels\n\nDuring your turn, except during combat or running away, you can discard items worth a total of at least 1,000 gold pieces and immediately go up one level. (\"No Value\" cards are the same as zero gold pieces.) If you discard, for example, 1,100 gold pieces worth, you don't get change. But if you can manage 2,000 worth, you can go up two levels at once, and so on.\n\nYou can sell items from your hand as well as those you are carrying. However, you cannot sell items to reach level 10.\n---\n---\nNAME: munchkin_rules/munchkin_rules-1.pdf\nPAGE: 2\nPASSAGE:\n# Turn Phases\n\nYour turn begins as soon as the previous player's turn ends. When you have arranged your cards as desired, proceed to phase 1.\n\n## Phase 1: Kick Open The Door\n- Draw one card from the Door deck and turn it face up.\n- If it's a monster, you must fight it. Refer to [Combat](#combat) on page 3.\n- If the card is a curse, apply it to you immediately (if possible) and discard it (unless it has a persistent effect or you keep the card as a reminder of an upcoming effect).\n- If you draw any other card, you may either put it in your hand or play it immediately.\n\n## Phase 2: Look For Trouble/Loot The Room\nIf you fought a monster during phase 1, skip this phase and go to phase 3. If you did NOT draw a monster when you first opened the door, you have two choices: either Look For Trouble or Loot The Room.\n\n### Look For Trouble\n- Play a monster from your hand and fight it, just as if you had found it when you kicked open the door. Do not play a monster you cannot handle, unless you're sure you can count on getting help (see [Help](#help) on page 4)!\n\n### Loot The Room\n- Draw a second card from the Door deck, face down, and place it in your hand.\n\n## Phase 3: Charity\n- If you have more than five cards in your hand, you must play enough cards to get you to five or below. For example, you can play Curses, sell Items from your hand, or play Items to the table.\n- If you cannot reduce your hand to five cards or do not want to, you must give the excess cards to the player with the lowest Level. If players are tied for lowest, divide the cards as evenly as possible, but it's up to you who gets the bigger set(s) of leftovers. If YOU are the lowest or tied for lowest, just discard the excess.\n\nAs soon as you are finished with Charity, the next player's turn begins.\n---"}, {"query": "What is an item in play but not equipped called?", "answer": "An item in play but not equipped is called a carried item.", "result": "An item in play but not equipped is called \"carried\" and indicated by turning the card sideways.", "context": "---\nNAME: munchkin_rules/munchkin_rules-1.pdf\nPAGE: 3\nPASSAGE:\nItems are the most common Treasures in Munchkin.

Hirelings can be found in Door decks in some sets, and Treasures in others (in this set, they're Doors). You can play a Hireling at any time, even during combat, as long as you have only one Hireling in play at a time. If you draw a face-up Hireling, you may put it in your hand if you cannot (or don't want to) put it in play. You may discard a Hireling at any time.\n\nA Hireling is not considered an Item unless it has a price on it. You may only trade Hirelings that have a Gold Piece value. A Hireling can sacrifice itself for you. If you lose a fight, instead of rolling to run away, you may discard one Hireling and anything he is carrying. You automatically escape from all monsters in the fight, even if a monster card says escape is impossible. If someone was helping you in the fight, you decide whether that person automatically escapes as well or must roll to escape.\n\nSome Hirelings give you extra Hands or let you carry an extra Big or Complex item. In this case, the Hireling does not actually have any Items; he merely increases your own abilities. If something happens to the Hireling, your Items are not affected.\n\nOther Hirelings, like the Elf Hireling from this set, can specifically carry and use an Item themselves; in some cases, a Hireling can use an Item you cannot use for yourself. The Items a Hireling carries count for you and are affected by Traps, Curses, and Bad Stuff as though you were carrying them yourself.\n\nIf your Hireling sacrifices himself to save you, any Items he was carrying are lost.\n\nIf your Hireling is killed, you loot the body yourself and keep the Items.\n---\n---\nNAME: munchkin_rules/munchkin_rules-1.pdf\nPAGE: 3\nPASSAGE:\n**ONE-SHOT TREASURES**\n\nA Treasure card with the text \"Usable once only\" is often referred to as a \"one-shot\" Treasure. These are typically used during combat to boost the munchkins or the monsters, and can be played from your hand or from the table. Some have other effects, so make sure to read the card carefully! Discard these cards as soon as the combat is over or their effect is resolved.\n\nOne-shot Items with a Gold Piece value can be sold for levels, just like other Items.\n\n**OTHER TREASURES**\n\nOther Treasure cards (like Go Up a Level cards) are not Items. Most of these cards specify when they can be played and whether they stay in play or are discarded. A couple of specific examples:\n\n- Go Up a Level cards can be played on yourself or any other player at any time, even during combat. Discard them once they are played. Note that you cannot play a Go Up a Level card to give a player the winning level!\n- Hireling can be played at any time, on any turn. However, you cannot give a Hireling an Item to carry while you are in combat.\n---\n---\nNAME: munchkin_rules/munchkin_rules-1.pdf\nPAGE: 3\nPASSAGE:\n# Items and Trading\n\nIf you have more than one item, you must sell them or give them to the lowest-level player(s) who can carry them. If there are still big items left over, discard them.\n\n## Trading Items\n\nYou can trade items with other players, but not other cards. You can only trade items from the table, not from your hand. The best time to trade is when it's not your turn.\n\nAny item you receive in a trade must remain in play. You can also give items away without a trade, as a bribe to other players.\n\n## Selling Items for Levels\n\nDuring your turn, except during combat or running away, you can discard items worth a total of at least 1,000 gold pieces and immediately go up one level. (\"No Value\" cards are the same as zero gold pieces.) If you discard, for example, 1,100 gold pieces worth, you don't get change. But if you can manage 2,000 worth, you can go up two levels at once, and so on.\n\nYou can sell items from your hand as well as those you are carrying. However, you cannot sell items to reach level 10.\n---"}, {"query": "If after breaking down the door I draw a steed face up, what are my options?", "answer": "You can put the steed into your hand, equip it, or treat as a monster and fight it.", "result": "If you draw a Steed face up during the Kick Open The Door phase, you can either treat it as a monster or an Item.

(See Fighting Multiple Monsters, below.)\n\nEach monster card represents a single monster, even if the name on the card is plural.\n\n# MONSTER ENHANCERS\nCertain cards, called monster enhancers, can increase or decrease the combat strength of individual monsters. (Penalties to monsters are still considered enhancers.) They also affect the number of Treasures the monsters are worth. Monster enhancers can be played by any player during any combat.\n\nAll enhancers on a single monster add together. If there are multiple monsters in a combat, the player who plays each enhancer must choose which monster it applies to.\n\nException: Anything that enhances a monster also enhances its Mate. If Ancient, Enraged, and Mate are played on a single monster, in any order, you are facing an Ancient Enraged monster and its Ancient Enraged Mate.\n\n# FIGHTING MULTIPLE MONSTERS\nSome cards, such as Wandering Monster, allow your rivals to send other monsters to join the fight. You must defeat their combined combat strengths. Any special abilities, such as forcing you to fight with your Level only, apply to the entire fight. If you have the right cards, you can eliminate one monster from the combat and fight the other(s) normally, but you cannot choose to fight one and Run Away from the other(s). If you eliminate one monster, but then run from the other(s), you don't get any levels or Treasure!\n---\n---\nNAME: munchkin_rules/munch_4_rules_20thp.pdf\nPAGE: 2\nPASSAGE:\nSteeds are a beloved item in the game of Munchkin, providing bonuses to players. They can be found in the Door deck and are subject to normal Item rules. A player cannot possess more than one Steed, except through the use of a Cheat! card. Steeds are classified as \"Big\" items, but do not count against the number of Big items a player can carry. This designation is used to control which Traps and Curses affect them and to prevent Thieves from pocketing them.\n\nThere are specific Items that enhance Steeds, and Steeds themselves cannot use Items unless the card explicitly states so. Item Enhancers do not affect Steed-enhancing Items. If a Steed provides a bonus or penalty to Run Away, it replaces the rider's bonus. An Elf, for example, normally has a bonus to Run Away, but would have a penalty if riding the Turtle Steed. If a Steed gives a penalty to Run Away, the player may discard the Steed before rolling to flee, avoiding the penalty but sending the card to the discard pile.\n\nA player who draws a face-up Steed may choose to treat it as a monster instead. In this case, its Level is equal to twice the combat bonus at the top of the card, and defeating it grants one Treasure and one level. Monster Enhancers may be played on Steeds being fought as monsters, and they have their normal effects. If a Steed is attacked as a monster, the consequence is \"Lose a level.\"\n---\n---\nNAME: munchkin_rules/munchkin_rules-1.pdf\nPAGE: 2\nPASSAGE:\n# Turn Phases\n\nYour turn begins as soon as the previous player's turn ends. When you have arranged your cards as desired, proceed to phase 1.\n\n## Phase 1: Kick Open The Door\n- Draw one card from the Door deck and turn it face up.\n- If it's a monster, you must fight it. Refer to [Combat](#combat) on page 3.\n- If the card is a curse, apply it to you immediately (if possible) and discard it (unless it has a persistent effect or you keep the card as a reminder of an upcoming effect).\n- If you draw any other card, you may either put it in your hand or play it immediately.\n\n## Phase 2: Look For Trouble/Loot The Room\nIf you fought a monster during phase 1, skip this phase and go to phase 3. If you did NOT draw a monster when you first opened the door, you have two choices: either Look For Trouble or Loot The Room.\n\n### Look For Trouble\n- Play a monster from your hand and fight it, just as if you had found it when you kicked open the door. Do not play a monster you cannot handle, unless you're sure you can count on getting help (see [Help](#help) on page 4)!\n\n### Loot The Room\n- Draw a second card from the Door deck, face down, and place it in your hand.\n\n## Phase 3: Charity\n- If you have more than five cards in your hand, you must play enough cards to get you to five or below. For example, you can play Curses, sell Items from your hand, or play Items to the table.\n- If you cannot reduce your hand to five cards or do not want to, you must give the excess cards to the player with the lowest Level. If players are tied for lowest, divide the cards as evenly as possible, but it's up to you who gets the bigger set(s) of leftovers. If YOU are the lowest or tied for lowest, just discard the excess.\n\nAs soon as you are finished with Charity, the next player's turn begins.\n---\n---\nNAME: munchkin_rules/munchkin_rules-1.pdf\nPAGE: 6\nPASSAGE:\nFaster Play Rules\n\nFor a quicker game, add a \"Phase 0\" called \"Listen at the Door.\" At the beginning of your turn, before performing any other action, draw a face-down Door card, which you may choose to play or not. Proceed with arranging cards and Kick Open The Door as usual. If you decide to Loot The Room, draw a face-down Treasure, not a Door.\n\nTypically, a Curse affects its victim immediately (if possible) and is then discarded. However, some Curses have a later-game penalty or a continuing effect. Keep these cards until you get rid of the Curse or the penalty takes effect. (Cards kept as reminders cannot be discarded to power Class or Race abilities.) You can also allow shared victories - if a player reaches Level 10 in a fight where you are the helper, you also win the game. Note: If someone plays a \"your next combat\" Curse on you while you are in combat, it counts in that combat! The same is true for a \"your next turn\" Curse played during your turn.\n\nGame Design by Steve Jackson\n@\nIllustrated by John Kovalic\n\nPresident/Editor-in-Chief: Steve Jackson\n@\nChief Executive Officer: Philip Reed\n@\nChief Operating Officer: Susan Bueno\n@\nChief Creative Officer: Sam Mitschke\n\nMunchkin Line Editor: Andrew Hackard\n@\nProduction Manager: Sabrina Gonzalez\n@\nProduction Artists: Alex Fernandez and Sabrina Gonzalez\n\nProject Manager: Darryll Silva\n@\nOperations Manager: Randy Scheunemann\n@\nDirector of Sales: Ross Jepson\n\nPlaytesters: Steve Brinich, Moe Chapman, Paul Chapman, Alain Dawson, Jessie D.

For example, you might describe your character as a \"Level 8 Elf Wizard with Boots of Butt-Kicking, a Staff of Napalm, and the Kneepads of Allure.\"\n\n## Level\nThis stat represents your overall strength and prowess. When the rules or cards refer to your Level (capitalized), they mean this number. You gain a level when you defeat a monster or when a card instructs you to do so. You can also purchase levels by selling items (see Items). You can lose a level when a card states that you must do so. Your Level can never be less than 1, but your combat strength can be negative if you are cursed or suffer other penalties.\n\n## Class\nCharacters can be Warriors, Wizards, Thieves, or Clerics. If you have no Class card in front of you, you have no class.\n\nEach Class has unique abilities, which are activated when you play the corresponding card. You gain these abilities as soon as you play the card and lose them when you discard it. Some Class abilities require discards to activate. You may discard any card, whether in play or in your hand, to power a special ability.\n\nRefer to the Class cards for information on when abilities can be used. Note that a Thief cannot steal while fighting or when the target is fighting, and as soon as a monster is revealed, the fight begins.\n\nYou can discard a Class card at any time, even during combat: \"I don't want to be a wizard anymore.\" When you discard a Class card, you become classless until you play another Class card.\n\nYou may not belong to more than one class at a time unless you play the Super Munchkin card.\n\n## Race\nCharacters can be Humans, Elves, Dwarves, or Halflings. If you have no Race card in front of you, you are human.\n---\n---\nNAME: munchkin_rules/princesses_rules.pdf\nPAGE: 1\nPASSAGE:\nDeveloped by Andrew Hackard\n\nBased on Steve Jackson's Munchkin\n\nIllustrated by John Kovalic\n\nAdditional Material by Steve Jackson, Devin Lewis, and Darryll Silva\n\nChief Operating Officer: Philip Reed\nManaging Editor: Miranda Horner\nMunchkin Czar: Andrew Hackard\nMunchkin Hireling: Devin Lewis\n\nProduction Manager: Samuel Mitschke\nProduction Artist: Benjamin Williams\nPrepress Checker: Monica Stephens\nMarketing Director: Leonard Balsera\nDirector of Sales: Ross Jepson\n\nSpecial thanks to Stacy Beckwith, Max Clontz, Sabrina Gonzalez, Miranda Horner, John Kovalic, Bridget Westerman, and Elisabeth Zakes for their regal suggestions and advice.\n\nMunchkin, the Munchkin characters, Warehouse 23, the all-seeing pyramid, and the names of all products published by Steve Jackson Games Incorporated are trademarks or registered trademarks of Ste Jackson Games Incorporated, or used under license.

When you have arranged your cards as desired, proceed to phase 1.\n\n## Phase 1: Kick Open The Door\n- Draw one card from the Door deck and turn it face up.\n- If it's a monster, you must fight it. Refer to [Combat](#combat) on page 3.\n- If the card is a curse, apply it to you immediately (if possible) and discard it (unless it has a persistent effect or you keep the card as a reminder of an upcoming effect).\n- If you draw any other card, you may either put it in your hand or play it immediately.\n\n## Phase 2: Look For Trouble/Loot The Room\nIf you fought a monster during phase 1, skip this phase and go to phase 3. If you did NOT draw a monster when you first opened the door, you have two choices: either Look For Trouble or Loot The Room.\n\n### Look For Trouble\n- Play a monster from your hand and fight it, just as if you had found it when you kicked open the door. Do not play a monster you cannot handle, unless you're sure you can count on getting help (see [Help](#help) on page 4)!\n\n### Loot The Room\n- Draw a second card from the Door deck, face down, and place it in your hand.\n\n## Phase 3: Charity\n- If you have more than five cards in your hand, you must play enough cards to get you to five or below. For example, you can play Curses, sell Items from your hand, or play Items to the table.\n- If you cannot reduce your hand to five cards or do not want to, you must give the excess cards to the player with the lowest Level. If players are tied for lowest, divide the cards as evenly as possible, but it's up to you who gets the bigger set(s) of leftovers. If YOU are the lowest or tied for lowest, just discard the excess.\n\nAs soon as you are finished with Charity, the next player's turn begins.\n---\n---\nNAME: munchkin_rules/munchkin_rules-1.pdf\nPAGE: 3\nPASSAGE:\nItems are the most common Treasures in Munchkin. They have a Gold Piece value, and a \"No Value\" card is equivalent to zero Gold Pieces. Items that are \"carried\" are considered to be in your possession, while those that are providing you with a bonus are \"equipped.\" To indicate that an Item is not equipped, turn the card sideways. You cannot alter the status of your Items during combat or while running away.\n\nAny player can carry any Item (except for extra Big items; see below), but you may equip only one Headgear, one suit of Armor, one pair of Footgear, and two \"I Hand\" Items (or one \"2 Hands\" Item) . . . unless you have a card that lets you ignore these limits, such as Hireling or Cheat!, or unless one of the cards says otherwise. If you are carrying two Headgear cards, for instance, you can equip only one of them at a time.\n\nSome Items have restrictions, such as the Mace of Sharpness, which can only be wielded by a Cleric. Its bonus only counts for someone who is, at the moment, a Cleric.\n\nYou cannot discard Item cards \"just because.\" You may sell Items for a level, trade Items with other players, or give an Item to another player who wants it (see below). You may discard Items to power certain Class and Race abilities. And a Curse or a monster's Bad Stuff (see p. 5) may force you to get rid of something!\n\nBig Items: You may carry any number of Small items, but only one Big one. (Any item not marked Big is considered Small.) You may not discard one Big item to play another; you must sell the first Item, trade it, lose it to a Curse or Bad Stuff, or discard it to power a Class or Race ability.\n---"}, {"query": "When can I play a Hireling?", "answer": "At any time.", "result": "A Hireling can be played at any time, even during combat, as long as only one Hireling is in play at a time.

You can play a Hireling at any time, even during combat, as long as you have only one Hireling in play at a time. If you draw a face-up Hireling, you may put it in your hand if you cannot (or don't want to) put it in play. You may discard a Hireling at any time.\n\nA Hireling is not considered an Item unless it has a price on it. You may only trade Hirelings that have a Gold Piece value. A Hireling can sacrifice itself for you. If you lose a fight, instead of rolling to run away, you may discard one Hireling and anything he is carrying. You automatically escape from all monsters in the fight, even if a monster card says escape is impossible. If someone was helping you in the fight, you decide whether that person automatically escapes as well or must roll to escape.\n\nSome Hirelings give you extra Hands or let you carry an extra Big or Complex item. In this case, the Hireling does not actually have any Items; he merely increases your own abilities. If something happens to the Hireling, your Items are not affected.\n\nOther Hirelings, like the Elf Hireling from this set, can specifically carry and use an Item themselves; in some cases, a Hireling can use an Item you cannot use for yourself. The Items a Hireling carries count for you and are affected by Traps, Curses, and Bad Stuff as though you were carrying them yourself.\n\nIf your Hireling sacrifices himself to save you, any Items he was carrying are lost.\n\nIf your Hireling is killed, you loot the body yourself and keep the Items.\n---\n---\nNAME: munchkin_rules/munchkin_rules-1.pdf\nPAGE: 3\nPASSAGE:\n**ONE-SHOT TREASURES**\n\nA Treasure card with the text \"Usable once only\" is often referred to as a \"one-shot\" Treasure. These are typically used during combat to boost the munchkins or the monsters, and can be played from your hand or from the table. Some have other effects, so make sure to read the card carefully! Discard these cards as soon as the combat is over or their effect is resolved.\n\nOne-shot Items with a Gold Piece value can be sold for levels, just like other Items.\n\n**OTHER TREASURES**\n\nOther Treasure cards (like Go Up a Level cards) are not Items. Most of these cards specify when they can be played and whether they stay in play or are discarded. A couple of specific examples:\n\n- Go Up a Level cards can be played on yourself or any other player at any time, even during combat. Discard them once they are played. Note that you cannot play a Go Up a Level card to give a player the winning level!\n- Hireling can be played at any time, on any turn.

Similarly, any monster with a bonus or penalty against a race, class, or sex will have the same effect on the player.\n\nBad Stuff does not affect Hirelings unless explicitly mentioned. When determining a monster's actions against you, ignore your Hireling's race, class, and sex.\n\n**Hirelings and Sex**\n\nPlease refrain from going there. The sex of a hireling is irrelevant, except for monster reactions or when assigning male-only or female-only items. In such cases, the hireling's sex is determined by the sex, if any, shown on its card. It should be evident to even the most inexperienced Munchkin player which are male, which are female, and which have no gender.\n\nRobots do not have a gender, even if their card text uses masculine pronouns. Ralph the Wonder Dog used to be male, but after a visit to the vet, we're not sure anymore.\n\nIf you ever want to change the sex of a Hireling, you'll need the Sex Change Potion.\n\n**Hirelings and Cheating**\n\nA Cheat! card can be used to give you an extra Hireling or to let a Hireling carry an item they normally couldn't (but why not just use the card on yourself?). No power on heaven or earth will let the Budget Hireling carry anything.\n---\n---\nNAME: munchkin_rules/munch_4_rules_20thp.pdf\nPAGE: 1\nPASSAGE:\n**Hireling Items**\n\nIf your Hireling sacrifices himself to save you, any items he was carrying are lost.\n\nIf your Hireling is killed, you loot the body yourself and keep the items.\n\nIf your Hireling is taken away by a trap/curse, by bad stuff, or by a change in loyalty, the items go with him!\n\n**Hirelings and Monster Bonuses**\n\nIf, for example, you have the Dwarf Hireling and you face a monster that gets a bonus against Dwarves, it gets the bonus against you unless you discard the Hireling. A monster that has a penalty will have that penalty applied to you if you have the corresponding Hireling.\n---\n---\nNAME: munchkin_rules/munchkin_rules-1.pdf\nPAGE: 2\nPASSAGE:\n**Super Munchkin and Half-Breed**\n\nThese cards can be played whenever it is legal to play a Class or Race card, as long as you have an appropriate card (Class for Super Munchkin, Race for Half-Breed) to attach it to. You cannot have more than one of the same Class or Race card in play at once.\n\nIf you play Super Munchkin with one Class, you receive all the advantages of being that Class (the ability to equip Class-only Items, monsters with penalties against that Class suffer those penalties), but none of the disadvantages (you can equip Items forbidden to that Class, and monsters do not get bonuses because of your Class). If the Class has an ability that has a cost, however, you must still pay it - you aren't that Super! If you play Super Munchkin while you have two Classes, you have all the normal advantages and disadvantages of both Classes. (All of the above is also true for Half-Breed, just for Races.)\n---"}, {"query": "Can I play a Hireling card if I already have a Hireling in play?", "answer": "No. You can only have one Hireling in play at a time.", "result": "Yes, you can play a Hireling card if you already have a Hireling in play.

It is designed to be played with the original Munchkin game and (likely) one or more of the previous expansions. If you choose not to use any other expansions, you'll encounter a plethora of Hirelings and Steeds, but this is not a drawback, as they all possess a high level of munchkin-ness.\n---\n---\nNAME: munchkin_rules/munchkin_rules-1.pdf\nPAGE: 1\nPASSAGE:\nCharacter Creation\n\nEvery player begins as a Level 1 human with no class (heh, heh). Munchkin characters can be either male or female, with your character's sex being the same as your own unless you declare otherwise.\n\nExamine your initial eight cards. If you have any Race or Class cards, you may choose to play one of each type by placing them in front of you. If you have any usable Items (see page B), you may also play them by placing them in front of you. If you are unsure about whether to play a card, you can read further or simply proceed and make the decision.\n\nStarting and Finishing the Game\n\nDetermine the first player by rolling the dice and engaging in discussion about the results. The meaning of this sentence and any perceived missing words should be considered.\n\nGameplay proceeds in turns, each consisting of several phases (see page 2). Once the first player completes their turn, the next player to the left takes their turn, and so on.\n\nThe first player to reach Level 10 wins, but they must do so by killing a monster. Unless a card specifically allows for an alternative method of victory.\n---"}, {"query": "When I loot the room, is the door card drawn face up or face down?", "answer": "The door card is drawn face down.", "result": "When you loot the room, you draw a door card face down and place it in your hand.", "context": "---\nNAME: munchkin_rules/munchkin_rules-1.pdf\nPAGE: 2\nPASSAGE:\n# Turn Phases\n\nYour turn begins as soon as the previous player's turn ends. When you have arranged your cards as desired, proceed to phase 1.\n\n## Phase 1: Kick Open The Door\n- Draw one card from the Door deck and turn it face up.\n- If it's a monster, you must fight it. Refer to [Combat](#combat) on page 3.\n- If the card is a curse, apply it to you immediately (if possible) and discard it (unless it has a persistent effect or you keep the card as a reminder of an upcoming effect).\n- If you draw any other card, you may either put it in your hand or play it immediately.\n\n## Phase 2: Look For Trouble/Loot The Room\nIf you fought a monster during phase 1, skip this phase and go to phase 3. If you did NOT draw a monster when you first opened the door, you have two choices: either Look For Trouble or Loot The Room.\n\n### Look For Trouble\n- Play a monster from your hand and fight it, just as if you had found it when you kicked open the door. Do not play a monster you cannot handle, unless you're sure you can count on getting help (see [Help](#help) on page 4)!\n\n### Loot The Room\n- Draw a second card from the Door deck, face down, and place it in your hand.\n\n## Phase 3: Charity\n- If you have more than five cards in your hand, you must play enough cards to get you to five or below. For example, you can play Curses, sell Items from your hand, or play Items to the table.\n- If you cannot reduce your hand to five cards or do not want to, you must give the excess cards to the player with the lowest Level. If players are tied for lowest, divide the cards as evenly as possible, but it's up to you who gets the bigger set(s) of leftovers. If YOU are the lowest or tied for lowest, just discard the excess.\n\nAs soon as you are finished with Charity, the next player's turn begins.\n---\n---\nNAME: munchkin_rules/munchkin_rules-1.pdf\nPAGE: 4\nPASSAGE:\n**MONSTERS**\n\nDuring the \"Kick Open The Door\" phase, if a monster card is drawn face-up, it immediately attacks the person who drew it. If a monster card is obtained through any other means, it goes into the player's hand and can be played during their turn to \"Look For Trouble\" or played to join another player's fight using the \"Wandering Monster\" card.\n\nEach monster card represents a single monster, even if the name on the card is plural.\n\n**MONSTER ENHANCERS**\n\nCertain cards, called \"monster enhancers,\" can increase or decrease the combat strength of individual monsters. These also affect the value of the monsters in terms of Treasures. Monster enhancers can be played by any player during any combat.\n\nAll enhancers on a single monster are added together. If there are multiple monsters in a combat, the player who plays each enhancer must choose which monster it applies to.\n\nException: Anything that enhances a monster also enhances its \"Mate.\" If \"Ancient,\" \"Enraged,\" and \"Mate\" are played on a single monster in any order, you are facing an \"Ancient Enraged\" monster and its \"Ancient Enraged Mate.\"\n\n**GOOD LUCK!**\n\n**FIGHTING MULTIPLE MONSTERS**\n\nSome cards, such as \"Wandering Monster,\" allow rivals to send additional monsters to join the fight. You must defeat their combined combat strengths. Any special abilities, such as forcing you to fight with your Level only, apply to the entire fight. If you have the right cards, you can eliminate one monster from the combat and fight the other(s) normally, but you cannot choose to fight one and Run Away from the other(s). If you eliminate one monster, but then run from the other(s), you don't get any levels or Treasure!\n---\n---\nNAME: munchkin_rules/munchkin_rules-1.pdf\nPAGE: 5\nPASSAGE:\n**Context: CURSES**\n\nIf a Curse card is drawn face-up during the Kick Open The Door phase, it affects the person who drew it. However, if acquired through other means, such as Looting The Room, the Curse card goes into your hand and can be played on any player at any time. Cursing someone right as they think they've defeated a monster can be a lot of fun.\n\nIf a Curse applies to more than one Item, the victim decides which Item is lost or Cursed. If a Curse applies to something you don't have, ignore it. For example, if you draw Lose Your Armor and you have no Armor, nothing happens; discard the card. (Some Curses have alternate effects, though, so read more in the Munchkin rules!)\n\nVisit [munchkin.game](http://munchkin.game) for news, errata, updates, Q&A, and much more.

Proceed with arranging cards and Kick Open The Door as usual. If you decide to Loot The Room, draw a face-down Treasure, not a Door.\n\nTypically, a Curse affects its victim immediately (if possible) and is then discarded. However, some Curses have a later-game penalty or a continuing effect. Keep these cards until you get rid of the Curse or the penalty takes effect. (Cards kept as reminders cannot be discarded to power Class or Race abilities.) You can also allow shared victories - if a player reaches Level 10 in a fight where you are the helper, you also win the game. Note: If someone plays a \"your next combat\" Curse on you while you are in combat, it counts in that combat! The same is true for a \"your next turn\" Curse played during your turn.\n\nGame Design by Steve Jackson\n@\nIllustrated by John Kovalic\n\nPresident/Editor-in-Chief: Steve Jackson\n@\nChief Executive Officer: Philip Reed\n@\nChief Operating Officer: Susan Bueno\n@\nChief Creative Officer: Sam Mitschke\n\nMunchkin Line Editor: Andrew Hackard\n@\nProduction Manager: Sabrina Gonzalez\n@\nProduction Artists: Alex Fernandez and Sabrina Gonzalez\n\nProject Manager: Darryll Silva\n@\nOperations Manager: Randy Scheunemann\n@\nDirector of Sales: Ross Jepson\n\nPlaytesters: Steve Brinich, Moe Chapman, Paul Chapman, Alain Dawson, Jessie D.

We love you all and you scare us deeply!\n---\n---\nNAME: munchkin_rules/munchkin_rules-1.pdf\nPAGE: 1\nPASSAGE:\nMunchkin brings you the essence of the dungeon-crawling experience without all that messy roleplaying! This game includes 168 cards, one six-sided die, and these rules. Three to six players can enjoy the game. You will need 10 tokens (coins, poker chips, or any gadget that counts to 10) for each player.\n\nSETUP\nDivide the cards into the Door deck and the Treasure deck. Shuffle both decks. Deal four cards from each deck to each player.\n\nCARD MANAGEMENT\nKeep separate face-up discard piles for the two decks. You may not look through the discards unless you play a card that allows you to! When a deck runs out, reshuffle its discards.\nIn Play: These are the cards on the table in front of you, showing your Race and Class (if any) and the Items you are carrying. Continuing Curses and some other cards also stay on the table after you play them. Cards in play are public information and must be visible to the other players.\n---"}, {"query": "Can I use a card to compel another player to help me in combat if winning that combat would give me the winning level?", "answer": "No. You cannot compel another player to get the winning level.", "result": "A: Based on the given board game rule excerpts, you cannot use a card to compel another player to help you in combat if winning that combat would give you the winning level, as these abilities are ineffective when fighting for the victory.", "context": "---\nNAME: munchkin_rules/munchkin_rules-1.pdf\nPAGE: 4\nPASSAGE:\nIn Munchkin, certain cards or abilities enable you to coerce another player into assisting you in combat. However, these abilities are ineffective when fighting for the victory. If you compel someone to aid you and the fight becomes a win-or-lose scenario, they are exempt from any penalties and can withdraw without consequences. Conversely, if you willingly help someone, you cannot withdraw simply because they are on the verge of winning the game; thus, it is crucial to remain vigilant.\n---\n---\nNAME: munchkin_rules/munchkin_rules-1.pdf\nPAGE: 4\nPASSAGE:\nAsking for Help\n\nIf you cannot win a combat on your own, you may ask another player to help you. If they refuse, you may ask another player, and so on, until they all turn you down or someone helps. Only one player can help you, adding their combat strength to yours. Anyone can play cards to affect your combat, however!\n\nYou'll probably have to bribe someone to help. You may offer your helper any items you are currently carrying, or any number of the treasure cards the monster has. If you offer part of the monster's treasure, you must agree whether they pick first, or you pick first, or whatever. You may also offer to play any cards from your hand that you legally could, such as Go Up a Level cards, on your helper.\n\nThe special abilities or vulnerabilities of the monster also apply to your helper, and vice versa. For instance, if a Warrior helps you, you will win if your combined total ties that of the monster, and your helper can Berserk and discard cards to add their combat strength (but only once per combat, not once per monster). If you are facing the Wannabe Vampire and a Cleric helps you, they can chase it away automatically. But if you are facing the Drooling Slime and an Elf helps you, the monster's combat strength is increased by 4 (unless you, too, are an Elf and the monster's combat strength has already been increased).\n\nIf someone successfully helps you kill the monster, discard it, draw treasures (see Rewards, below), and follow any special instructions on the monster card. You level up for each slain monster. Your helper does not go up any levels, unless they are an Elf, in which case they gain one level for each monster slain. You draw the treasure cards, even if it was your helper's special ability that defeated the monster, and distribute them according to the agreement you reached.\n---\n---\nNAME: munchkin_rules/munchkin_rules-1.pdf\nPAGE: 4\nPASSAGE:\n# MONSTERS\nIf a monster card is drawn face-up during the Kick Open The Door phase, it immediately attacks the person who drew it. \n\nIf you obtain a monster card through any other means, it goes into your hand and can be played during your own turn to Look For Trouble or played to join another player's fight with the Wandering Monster card. (See Fighting Multiple Monsters, below.)\n\nEach monster card represents a single monster, even if the name on the card is plural.\n\n# MONSTER ENHANCERS\nCertain cards, called monster enhancers, can increase or decrease the combat strength of individual monsters. (Penalties to monsters are still considered enhancers.) They also affect the number of Treasures the monsters are worth. Monster enhancers can be played by any player during any combat.\n\nAll enhancers on a single monster add together. If there are multiple monsters in a combat, the player who plays each enhancer must choose which monster it applies to.\n\nException: Anything that enhances a monster also enhances its Mate. If Ancient, Enraged, and Mate are played on a single monster, in any order, you are facing an Ancient Enraged monster and its Ancient Enraged Mate.\n\n# FIGHTING MULTIPLE MONSTERS\nSome cards, such as Wandering Monster, allow your rivals to send other monsters to join the fight. You must defeat their combined combat strengths. Any special abilities, such as forcing you to fight with your Level only, apply to the entire fight. If you have the right cards, you can eliminate one monster from the combat and fight the other(s) normally, but you cannot choose to fight one and Run Away from the other(s). If you eliminate one monster, but then run from the other(s), you don't get any levels or Treasure!\n---\n---\nNAME: munchkin_rules/munchkin_rules-1.pdf\nPAGE: 4\nPASSAGE:\nInterfering with Combat\n\nThere are several ways to interfere with others' combats, such as:\n\n1. Use a one-shot card: You can help another player by using a one-shot to strengthen their side, or \"accidentally\" strengthen the monster instead.\n2. Play a monster enhancer: These cards (usually) make a monster stronger and give it more Treasure. You can play these either during your own combats or during someone else's combat.\n3. Add a monster from your hand to join the combat: You can do this with a Wandering Monster card or by using the special Undead rule.\n4. Backstab a player in combat, if you're a Thief.\n5. Curse them, if you have a Curse card.\n\nREWARDS\n\nWhen you kill a monster, you gain one level per monster, unless the monster card states otherwise, and you get all its Treasure! Each monster has a Treasure number on the bottom of its card. Draw that many Treasures, modified by any monster enhancers played on it.\n\n1. Draw face-down if you killed the monster alone.\n2. Draw face-up, so the whole party can see what you got, if someone helped you, even if they aren't taking any Treasures (Sucker).\n\nIf you defeat a monster by nonlethal means, you do not gain a level and may or may not get the Treasure, depending on the method.\n\nTreasure cards can be played as soon as you get them, even if you are the helper.\n---\n---\nNAME: munchkin_rules/munchkin_rules-1.pdf\nPAGE: 1\nPASSAGE:\nConflicts Between Cards and Rules\n\nThis rulesheet provides the general rules. Many cards introduce special rules, so in most cases when the rulesheet contradicts a card, follow the card. However, disregard any card effect that seems to contradict one of the rules listed below unless the card explicitly states that it supersedes that rule.\n\n1. No card can reduce a player below Level 1, although a card may reduce a player's or a monster's combat strength (p. 3) below Level 1.\n2. You go up a level after combat only if you defeat a monster.\n3. You cannot collect rewards for defeating a monster (e.g., Treasure, levels) during combat. You must complete the fight before gaining any rewards.\n4. You must kill a monster to reach Level 10, and you cannot force another player to help you do it.\n\nFor any other disputes, settle them through loud arguments, with the owner of the game having the final say. You could also refer to the Munchkin FAQ and errata pages at [munchkin.game](https://munchkin.game) or start a discussion at [forums.sjgames.com/](https://forums.sjgames.com/) (unless it's more fun to argue).\n\nSTEVE JACKSON GAMES\n\nYour Hand: Cards in your hand are not in play. They don't help you, but they can't be taken away except by cards that specifically affect \"your hand.\" At the end of your turn, you may have no more than five cards in your hand (see Charity, p- 2).\n\nCards in play may not be returned to your hand - they must be discarded or traded if you want to get rid of them.\n---"}, {"query": "Can I play a Go Up a Level card on another player?", "answer": "Yes.", "result": "A: Yes, you can play a Go Up a Level card on another player.", "context": "---\nNAME: munchkin_rules/munchkin_rules-1.pdf\nPAGE: 3\nPASSAGE:\n**ONE-SHOT TREASURES**\n\nA Treasure card with the text \"Usable once only\" is often referred to as a \"one-shot\" Treasure. These are typically used during combat to boost the munchkins or the monsters, and can be played from your hand or from the table. Some have other effects, so make sure to read the card carefully! Discard these cards as soon as the combat is over or their effect is resolved.\n\nOne-shot Items with a Gold Piece value can be sold for levels, just like other Items.\n\n**OTHER TREASURES**\n\nOther Treasure cards (like Go Up a Level cards) are not Items. Most of these cards specify when they can be played and whether they stay in play or are discarded. A couple of specific examples:\n\n- Go Up a Level cards can be played on yourself or any other player at any time, even during combat. Discard them once they are played. Note that you cannot play a Go Up a Level card to give a player the winning level!\n- Hireling can be played at any time, on any turn. However, you cannot give a Hireling an Item to carry while you are in combat.\n---\n---\nNAME: munchkin_rules/munchkin_rules-1.pdf\nPAGE: 5\nPASSAGE:\nIn the game of Munchkin, when a player dies, they lose all their in-game items, but retain their Class(es), Race(s), Level, Curses, Half-Breed, and Super Munchkin status. Their new character will have the same attributes as the old one. Once a player has died, they do not need to Run Away from any remaining monsters.\n\nLooting the Body: Players lay out their hand beside the cards they had in play, excluding the cards mentioned above. If a player has an Item carried by a Hireling or attached to a Cheat! card, they separate those cards. Starting with the player with the highest Level, each player chooses one card. In case of ties in Level, a die roll determines the order. Once everyone has chosen a card, the remaining cards are discarded. If a player's corpse runs out of cards, they cannot receive any more cards, even through Charity or gifts from other players.\n\nDead characters cannot level up or win the game. When the next player begins their turn, the newly revived character appears and can help others in combat with their Level and Class or Race abilities, but they have no cards unless they receive Charity or gifts from other players. On their next turn, the player draws four face-down cards from each deck and plays any legal cards they want to, just as when they started the game. Then they take their turn normally.\n---\n---\nNAME: munchkin_rules/munchkin_rules-1.pdf\nPAGE: 1\nPASSAGE:\nConflicts Between Cards and Rules\n\nThis rulesheet provides the general rules.

If a monster card is obtained through any other means, it goes into the player's hand and can be played during their turn to \"Look For Trouble\" or played to join another player's fight using the \"Wandering Monster\" card.\n\nEach monster card represents a single monster, even if the name on the card is plural.\n\n**MONSTER ENHANCERS**\n\nCertain cards, called \"monster enhancers,\" can increase or decrease the combat strength of individual monsters. These also affect the value of the monsters in terms of Treasures. Monster enhancers can be played by any player during any combat.\n\nAll enhancers on a single monster are added together. If there are multiple monsters in a combat, the player who plays each enhancer must choose which monster it applies to.\n\nException: Anything that enhances a monster also enhances its \"Mate.\" If \"Ancient,\" \"Enraged,\" and \"Mate\" are played on a single monster in any order, you are facing an \"Ancient Enraged\" monster and its \"Ancient Enraged Mate.\"\n\n**GOOD LUCK!**\n\n**FIGHTING MULTIPLE MONSTERS**\n\nSome cards, such as \"Wandering Monster,\" allow rivals to send additional monsters to join the fight. You must defeat their combined combat strengths. Any special abilities, such as forcing you to fight with your Level only, apply to the entire fight. If you have the right cards, you can eliminate one monster from the combat and fight the other(s) normally, but you cannot choose to fight one and Run Away from the other(s). If you eliminate one monster, but then run from the other(s), you don't get any levels or Treasure!\n---"}, {"query": "Can I play a Curse while in combat?", "answer": "Yes. A curse may be played at any time.", "result": "A: Yes, you can play a Curse while in combat. The rules state that if a Curse card is drawn face-up during the Kick Open The Door phase, it affects the person who drew it.

Proceed with arranging cards and Kick Open The Door as usual. If you decide to Loot The Room, draw a face-down Treasure card instead of a Door.\n\nTypically, a Curse affects its victim immediately (if possible) and is then discarded. However, some Curses have a later-game penalty or a continuous effect. Keep these cards until you eliminate the Curse or the penalty takes effect. (Cards kept as reminders cannot be discarded to power Class or Race abilities.) You can also allow shared victories - if a player reaches Level 10 in a fight where you are the helper, you also win the game.

However, if acquired through other means, such as Looting The Room, the Curse card goes into your hand and can be played on any player at any time. Cursing someone right as they think they've defeated a monster can be a lot of fun.\n\nIf a Curse applies to more than one Item, the victim decides which Item is lost or Cursed. If a Curse applies to something you don't have, ignore it. For example, if you draw Lose Your Armor and you have no Armor, nothing happens; discard the card.

When you have arranged your cards as desired, proceed to phase 1.\n\n## Phase 1: Kick Open The Door\n- Draw one card from the Door deck and turn it face up.\n- If it's a monster, you must fight it. Refer to [Combat](#combat) on page 3.\n- If the card is a curse, apply it to you immediately (if possible) and discard it (unless it has a persistent effect or you keep the card as a reminder of an upcoming effect).\n- If you draw any other card, you may either put it in your hand or play it immediately.\n\n## Phase 2: Look For Trouble/Loot The Room\nIf you fought a monster during phase 1, skip this phase and go to phase 3. If you did NOT draw a monster when you first opened the door, you have two choices: either Look For Trouble or Loot The Room.\n\n### Look For Trouble\n- Play a monster from your hand and fight it, just as if you had found it when you kicked open the door. Do not play a monster you cannot handle, unless you're sure you can count on getting help (see [Help](#help) on page 4)!\n\n### Loot The Room\n- Draw a second card from the Door deck, face down, and place it in your hand.\n\n## Phase 3: Charity\n- If you have more than five cards in your hand, you must play enough cards to get you to five or below. For example, you can play Curses, sell Items from your hand, or play Items to the table.\n- If you cannot reduce your hand to five cards or do not want to, you must give the excess cards to the player with the lowest Level. If players are tied for lowest, divide the cards as evenly as possible, but it's up to you who gets the bigger set(s) of leftovers. If YOU are the lowest or tied for lowest, just discard the excess.\n\nAs soon as you are finished with Charity, the next player's turn begins.\n---\n---\nNAME: munchkin_rules/munchkin_rules-1.pdf\nPAGE: 4\nPASSAGE:\nInterfering with Combat\n\nThere are several ways to interfere with others' combats, such as:\n\n1.

For example, you might describe your character as a \"Level 8 Elf Wizard with Boots of Butt-Kicking, a Staff of Napalm, and the Kneepads of Allure.\"\n\n## Level\nThis stat represents your overall strength and prowess. When the rules or cards refer to your Level (capitalized), they mean this number. You gain a level when you defeat a monster or when a card instructs you to do so. You can also purchase levels by selling items (see Items). You can lose a level when a card states that you must do so. Your Level can never be less than 1, but your combat strength can be negative if you are cursed or suffer other penalties.\n\n## Class\nCharacters can be Warriors, Wizards, Thieves, or Clerics. If you have no Class card in front of you, you have no class.\n\nEach Class has unique abilities, which are activated when you play the corresponding card. You gain these abilities as soon as you play the card and lose them when you discard it. Some Class abilities require discards to activate. You may discard any card, whether in play or in your hand, to power a special ability.\n\nRefer to the Class cards for information on when abilities can be used. Note that a Thief cannot steal while fighting or when the target is fighting, and as soon as a monster is revealed, the fight begins.\n\nYou can discard a Class card at any time, even during combat: \"I don't want to be a wizard anymore.\" When you discard a Class card, you become classless until you play another Class card.\n\nYou may not belong to more than one class at a time unless you play the Super Munchkin card.\n\n## Race\nCharacters can be Humans, Elves, Dwarves, or Halflings. If you have no Race card in front of you, you are human.\n---\n---\nNAME: munchkin_rules/munchkin_rules-1.pdf\nPAGE: 3\nPASSAGE:\nItems are the most common Treasures in Munchkin. They have a Gold Piece value, and a \"No Value\" card is equivalent to zero Gold Pieces. Items that are \"carried\" are considered to be in your possession, while those that are providing you with a bonus are \"equipped.\" To indicate that an Item is not equipped, turn the card sideways. You cannot alter the status of your Items during combat or while running away.\n\nAny player can carry any Item (except for extra Big items; see below), but you may equip only one Headgear, one suit of Armor, one pair of Footgear, and two \"I Hand\" Items (or one \"2 Hands\" Item) . . . unless you have a card that lets you ignore these limits, such as Hireling or Cheat!, or unless one of the cards says otherwise. If you are carrying two Headgear cards, for instance, you can equip only one of them at a time.\n\nSome Items have restrictions, such as the Mace of Sharpness, which can only be wielded by a Cleric. Its bonus only counts for someone who is, at the moment, a Cleric.\n\nYou cannot discard Item cards \"just because.\" You may sell Items for a level, trade Items with other players, or give an Item to another player who wants it (see below). You may discard Items to power certain Class and Race abilities. And a Curse or a monster's Bad Stuff (see p. 5) may force you to get rid of something!\n\nBig Items: You may carry any number of Small items, but only one Big one. (Any item not marked Big is considered Small.) You may not discard one Big item to play another; you must sell the first Item, trade it, lose it to a Curse or Bad Stuff, or discard it to power a Class or Race ability.\n---\n---\nNAME: munchkin_rules/munchkin_rules-1.pdf\nPAGE: 3\nPASSAGE:\nCombat\nTo engage in combat with a monster, compare its combat strength to yours. Combat strength is calculated by adding your Level and all positive or negative modifiers from Items and other cards. If the monster's combat strength is equal to or greater than yours, you lose the combat and must Run Away (see page 5). If your combat strength surpasses the monster's (remember, monsters win ties!), you defeat it and gain a level (two levels for some larger monsters). You'll also receive the number of Treasures shown on its card.\n\nSometimes, a card may allow you to eliminate the monster without defeating it. This is still considered a victory, but you won't gain a level. Unless the ability states otherwise, you won't receive the Treasures either. If the last monster is removed from combat, the combat ends immediately.\n\nSome monster cards have special abilities that affect combat, such as bonuses against a specific Race or Class. Make sure to check these!\n\nDuring combat, you and other players can use one-shot Treasures, Class or Race abilities, or even certain Door cards to assist or hinder you in the combat.\n\nUpon defeating a monster (or monsters!), discard the monster(s) and any other cards played, and claim your rewards. However, be prepared for someone to play a hostile card on you or use a special power just as you think you have won. When you defeat a monster, give a reasonable waiting time (approximately 2.6 seconds) for others to speak up. After that, you have truly defeated the monster, and you truly gain the levels and Treasures, although they can still complain and argue.\n---\n---\nNAME: munchkin_rules/munchkin_rules-1.pdf\nPAGE: 6\nPASSAGE:\nFaster Play Rules\n\nFor a quicker game, add a \"Phase 0\" called \"Listen at the Door.\" At the beginning of your turn, before performing any other action, draw a face-down Door card, which you may choose to play or not.

Its bonus only counts for someone who is, at the moment, a Cleric.\n\nYou cannot discard Item cards \"just because.\" You may sell Items for a level, trade Items with other players, or give an Item to another player who wants it (see below). You may discard Items to power certain Class and Race abilities. And a Curse or a monster's Bad Stuff (see p. 5) may force you to get rid of something!\n\nBig Items: You may carry any number of Small items, but only one Big one. (Any item not marked Big is considered Small.) You may not discard one Big item to play another; you must sell the first Item, trade it, lose it to a Curse or Bad Stuff, or discard it to power a Class or Race ability.\n---\n---\nNAME: munchkin_rules/munchkin_rules-1.pdf\nPAGE: 2\nPASSAGE:\n**Super Munchkin and Half-Breed**\n\nThese cards can be played whenever it is legal to play a Class or Race card, as long as you have an appropriate card (Class for Super Munchkin, Race for Half-Breed) to attach it to. You cannot have more than one of the same Class or Race card in play at once.\n\nIf you play Super Munchkin with one Class, you receive all the advantages of being that Class (the ability to equip Class-only Items, monsters with penalties against that Class suffer those penalties), but none of the disadvantages (you can equip Items forbidden to that Class, and monsters do not get bonuses because of your Class). If the Class has an ability that has a cost, however, you must still pay it - you aren't that Super! If you play Super Munchkin while you have two Classes, you have all the normal advantages and disadvantages of both Classes. (All of the above is also true for Half-Breed, just for Races.)\n---\n---\nNAME: munchkin_rules/munchkin_rules-1.pdf\nPAGE: 6\nPASSAGE:\nFaster Play Rules\n\nFor a quicker game, add a \"Phase 0\" called \"Listen at the Door.\" At the beginning of your turn, before performing any other action, draw a face-down Door card, which you may choose to play or not. Proceed with arranging cards and Kick Open The Door as usual. If you decide to Loot The Room, draw a face-down Treasure card instead of a Door.\n\nTypically, a Curse affects its victim immediately (if possible) and is then discarded. However, some Curses have a later game penalty or a continuous effect. Keep these cards until you get rid of the Curse or the penalty takes effect. (Cards kept as reminders cannot be discarded to power Class or Race abilities.) You can also allow shared victories - if a player reaches Level 10 in a fight where you are the helper, you also win the game. Note: If someone plays a \"your next combat\" Curse on you while you are in combat, it counts in that combat! The same is true for a \"your next turn\" Curse played during your turn.\n\nGame Design by Steve Jackson\n@\nIllustrated by John Kovalic\n\nPresident/Editor-in-Chief: Steve Jackson\n@\nChief Executive Officer: Philip Reed\n@\nChief Operating Officer: Susan Bueno\n@\nChief Creative Officer: Sam Mitschke\n\nMunchkin Line Editor: Andrew Hackard\n@\nProduction Manager: Sabrina Gonzalez\n@\nProduction Artists: Alex Fernandez and Sabrina Gonzalez\n\nProject Manager: Darryll Silva\n@\nOperations Manager: Randy Scheunemann\n@\nDirector of Sales: Ross Jepson\n\nPlaytesters: Steve Brinich, Moe Chapman, Paul Chapman, Alain Dawson, Jessie D.

We love you all and you scare us deeply!\n---\n---\nNAME: munchkin_rules/munchkin_rules-1.pdf\nPAGE: 1\nPASSAGE:\nCharacter Creation\n\nEvery player begins as a Level 1 human with no class (heh, heh). Munchkin characters can be either male or female, with your character's sex being the same as your own unless you declare otherwise.\n\nExamine your initial eight cards. If you have any Race or Class cards, you may choose to play one of each type by placing them in front of you. If you have any usable Items (see page B), you may also play them by placing them in front of you. If you are unsure about whether to play a card, you can read further or simply proceed and make the decision.\n\nStarting and Finishing the Game\n\nDetermine the first player by rolling the dice and engaging in discussion about the results. The meaning of this sentence and any perceived missing words should be considered.\n\nGameplay proceeds in turns, each consisting of several phases (see page 2). Once the first player completes their turn, the next player to the left takes their turn, and so on.\n\nThe first player to reach Level 10 wins, but they must do so by killing a monster. Unless a card specifically allows for an alternative method of victory.\n---"}]
