Combat strength is the total of Level plus all modifiers - positive or negative - given by Items and other cards. If the monster's combat strength is equal to yours, or greater, you lose the combat and must Run Away (see p. 5). If your combat strength totals more than the monster's \u2014 note that monsters win ties! \u2014 you kill it and goupa level (two levels for some big monsters). You'll also get the number of Treasures shown on its card.\nSometimes a card will let you get rid of the monster without killing it. This is still \u201cwinning,\u201d but you don't get a level. Unless the ability says otherwise, you don\u2019t get the Treasures, either. If the last monster is removed from a combat, it ends instantly.\nSome monster cards have special powers that affect combat \u2014 a bonus against a Race or Class, for instance. Be sure to check these!\nYou and the other players may play one-shot Treasures or use Class or Race abilities to help or harm you in your combat. Some Door cards may also be played into a combat, such as monster enhancers (see below).\nIf you kill a monster (or monsters!), discard the monster(s) and any other cards played, and claim your rewards. But note: someone may play a hostile card on you, or use a special power, just as you think you have won. When you kill a monster, you must wait a reasonable time, defined as about 2.6 seconds, for anyone else to speak up. After that, you have really killed the monster, and you really get the level(s) and Treasures, though they can still whine and argue.\n\nAg\n\nCombat: Basic Rules\nWhen you fight a monster, you compare your combat strength (your Level plus any bonuses or penalties) against the monster's combat strength. If your combat strength is greater, you win! If it is tied or lower, the monster wins. For the full explanation, see Combat, p- 3.\n\nASKING FOR HELP\nIfyoucannotwinacombatonyourown,you mayaskanyotherplayer to help you. Ifhe refuses, you may ask another player, and so on, until they all turn you down or someone helps. Only one player can help you, adding their combat strength to yours. Anyone can play cards to affect your combat, however!\nYou'll probably have to bribe someone to help. You may offer your helper any Item(s) you are currently carrying, or any number of the Treasure cards the monster has. If you offer part of the monster's Treasure, you must agree whether they pick first, or you pick first, or whatever. You may also offer to play any cards from your hand that you legally could, such as Go Up a Level cards, on your helper.\nThe special abilities or vulnerabilities of the monster also apply to your helper, and vice versa. For instance, if a Warrior helps you, you will win if your combined total ties that of the monster, and your helper can Berserk and discard cards to add their his combat strength (but only once per combat, not once per monster). If you are facing the Wannabe Vampire and a Cleric helps you, they can chase it away automatically. But if you are facing the Drooling Slime and an Elf helps you, the monster's combat strength is increased by 4 (unless you, too, are an Elf and the monster's combat strength has already been increased).\nIf someone successfully helps you kill the monster, discard it, draw Treasures (see Rewards, below), and follow any special instructions on the monster card. You level up for each slain monster. Your helper does not go up any levels . . . unless the helper is an Elf, in which case they gain one level for each monster slain. You draw the Treasure cards, even if it was your helper\u2019s special ability that defeated the monster, and distribute them according to the agreement you reached.\n\nSuzan: Not the Yuppie Water! Noooo oe\nAric: That's +3 to me, and now we're tied, 15 to 15. Because I\u2019m a Warrior, I win ties... so I\u2019m killing the Net Troll unless someone else plans to mess with me. Anyone?\nNo one says anything, so Aric goes up a level and claims the Net Troll's treasures \u2014 three from the Net Troll card, and one extra because it was Enraged. And the game goes on...\n\nRUNNING AWAY\nIf nobody will help you . . . or if somebody tries to help, and your fellow party members interfere so the two of you still cannot win... you must Run Away. You don't get any levels or Treasure. You don't even get to Loot the Room. And you don't always escape unharmed . . .\nRoll the die. You escape ona 5 or more. Some Class and Race abilities and some Treasures make it easier or harder to Run Away from all monsters. And some monsters give you a bonus or penalty to your roll for that monster only.\nIf you fail to Run Away from a monster, it does Bad Stuff to you, as described on its card. This may vary from losing an Item, to losing one or more levels, to Death (see below).\nIf you are fleeing from multiple monsters, you roll separately to escape each one, in any order you choose, and suffer Bad Stuff from each one that catches you as soon as it catches you.\nIf two players are cooperating and still can\u2019t defeat the monster(s), they must both Run Away. They roll separately for each monster, in whatever order they like. (If they can't decide, roll the die; the high roller decides who Runs Away first.) The monster(s) CAN catch them both.\nOnce you have resolved all Run Away rolls, discard the monster(s).\n\nConflicts Between Cards and Rules\nThis rulesheet gives the general tules. Many cards add special rules, so in most cases when the rulesheet disagrees with a card, follow the card. However, ignore any card effect that might seem to contradict one of the rules listed below unless the card explicitly says it supersedes that rule!\niL Nothing can reduce a player below Level 1, although card effects might reduce a player's or a monster's combat strength (p. 3) below I.\n2. You go up a level after combat only if you Ail a monster.\n3. You cannot collect rewards for defeating a monster (eg., Treasure, levels) in the middle of a combat. You must finish the fight before gaining any rewards.\n4. You must killa monster to reach Level 10, and you cannot force another player to help you do it.\nAny other disputes should be settled by loud arguments, with the owner of the game having the last word. You could also read the Munchkin FAQ and errata pages at munchkin.game, or start a discussion at forums.sjgames.com/, munchkin . . . unless it\u2019s more fun to argue.\n\nSTEVE JACKSON GAMES\nYour Hand: Cards in your hand are not in play.

The same is true for any monster that has a bonus or penalty against any race, class, or sex.\nBad Stuff does not affect Hirelings unless it specifically mentions them.

In that case, the Hireling is of the sex, if any, shown on its card. It should be pretty obvious, even to your munchkin players, which are male, which are female, and which have no sex at all.\nRobots never have a gender, even if their card text uses masculine pronouns. Ralph the Wonder Dog used to be male, but we took him to the vet.\nIf you ever want to change the sex of a Hireling, you need the Sex Change Potion.\n\nHirelings and Cheating\nA Cheat! card can be used to give you an extra Hireling, or to let a Hireling carry an item he normally could not (but why not just use the card on yourself?).

You cannot give a Hireling an Item to carry while you are in combat, however.\n\nHIRELINGS\nHirelings, Sidekicks, Monks, Minions, Comrades, and Allies are all the same for the purposes of these rules.\nHirelings are found in Door decks in some sets, Treasures in others. (In this set, they're Doors.) You can play a Hireling at any time, even in combat, as long as you have only one Hireling in play at a time. If you draw a face-up Hireling, you may put it in your hand if you cannot (or don\u2019t want to) put it in play. You may discard a Hireling at any time.\nA Hireling is not an Item unless it has a price on it. You may only trade Hirelings that have a Gold Piece value.\nA Hireling can sacrifice himself for you. If you lose a fight, then instead of rolling to run away, you may discard one Hireling and anything he is carrying. You automatically escape from all monsters in the fight, even if a monster card says escape is impossible. If someone was helping you in the fight, YOU decide whether that person automatically escapes as well, or must roll to escape.\nSome Hirelings give you extra Hands, or let you carry an extra Big or Complex item. In this case, the Hireling does not actually have any Items . . . he merely increases your own abilities. If something happens to the Hireling, your Items are not affected.\nOther Hirelings, like the Elf Hireling from this set, can specifically carry and use an Item themselves; in some cases, a Hireling can use an Item you cannot use for yourself.

Steeds are found in the Door deck.\nNo player can have more than one Steed except by using a Cheat! card.\nSteeds are Items, and follow normal Item rules. Anything that affects an Item can affect a Steed.\nSteeds carry themselves. A Steed is \u201cBig,\u201d but it does not count against the number of Big items you can carry (in fact, some let you carry more Big things). The \u201cBig\u201d designation on Steeds is to control what Traps and Curses affect them, and to keep Thieves from pocketing them and walking off.\nThere are a few Items that specifically enhance Steeds. Steeds cannot use Items unless the Item card specifically says so, and Item Enhancers don\u2019t affect Steed-enhancing Items.\nIf a Steed has a bonus or penalty to Run Away, that replaces the bonus of the rider. An Elf normally has a bonus to Run Away, but he has a penalty if he is riding the Turtle Steed! If your Steed gives you a penalty to Run Away, you may discard the Steed before you roll to flee. You don\u2019t suffer the penalty, but the card goes to the discard pile.\n\nTreating Steeds as Monsters\nA player who draws a face-up Steed may choose to treat it as a monster instead. In that case, its Level is equal to twice the combat bonus at the top of the card, and defeating it is good for one Treasure and one level.

Each monster has a Treasure number on the bottom of its card. Draw that many Treasures, modified by any monster enhancers played on it. Draw face-down if you killed the monster alone. Draw face-up, so the whole party can see what you got, if someone helped you, even if they aren't taking any Treasures.

Ifhe refuses, you may ask another player, and so on, until they all turn you down or someone helps. Only one player can help you, adding their combat strength to yours. Anyone can play cards to affect your combat, however!\nYou'll probably have to bribe someone to help. You may offer your helper any Item(s) you are currently carrying, or any number of the Treasure cards the monster has. If you offer part of the monster's Treasure, you must agree whether they pick first, or you pick first, or whatever. You may also offer to play any cards from your hand that you legally could, such as Go Up a Level cards, on your helper.\nThe special abilities or vulnerabilities of the monster also apply to your helper, and vice versa. For instance, if a Warrior helps you, you will win if your combined total ties that of the monster, and your helper can Berserk and discard cards to add their his combat strength (but only once per combat, not once per monster). If you are facing the Wannabe Vampire and a Cleric helps you, they can chase it away automatically. But if you are facing the Drooling Slime and an Elf helps you, the monster's combat strength is increased by 4 (unless you, too, are an Elf and the monster's combat strength has already been increased).\nIf someone successfully helps you kill the monster, discard it, draw Treasures (see Rewards, below), and follow any special instructions on the monster card. You level up for each slain monster. Your helper does not go up any levels . . . unless the helper is an Elf, in which case they gain one level for each monster slain. You draw the Treasure cards, even if it was your helper\u2019s special ability that defeated the monster, and distribute them according to the agreement you reached.\n\nCOMBAT\nTo fight a monster, compare its combat strength to yours. Combat strength is the total of Level plus all modifiers - positive or negative - given by Items and other cards. If the monster's combat strength is equal to yours, or greater, you lose the combat and must Run Away (see p. 5). If your combat strength totals more than the monster's \u2014 note that monsters win ties! \u2014 you kill it and goupa level (two levels for some big monsters). You'll also get the number of Treasures shown on its card.\nSometimes a card will let you get rid of the monster without killing it. This is still \u201cwinning,\u201d but you don't get a level. Unless the ability says otherwise, you don\u2019t get the Treasures, either. If the last monster is removed from a combat, it ends instantly.\nSome monster cards have special powers that affect combat \u2014 a bonus against a Race or Class, for instance. Be sure to check these!\nYou and the other players may play one-shot Treasures or use Class or Race abilities to help or harm you in your combat. Some Door cards may also be played into a combat, such as monster enhancers (see below).\nIf you kill a monster (or monsters!), discard the monster(s) and any other cards played, and claim your rewards. But note: someone may play a hostile card on you, or use a special power, just as you think you have won. When you kill a monster, you must wait a reasonable time, defined as about 2.6 seconds, for anyone else to speak up. After that, you have really killed the monster, and you really get the level(s) and Treasures, though they can still whine and argue.\n\nMUNCHKIN brings you the essence of the dungeon-crawling experience . .. without all that messy roleplaying!\nThis game includes 168 cards, one six-sided die, and these rules. Three to six can play. You will need 10 tokens (coins, poker chips, whatever - or any gadget that counts to 10) for each player.\n\nSETUP\nDivide the cards into the Door deck and the Treasure deck. Shuffle both decks. Deal four cards from each deck to each player.\n\nCARD MANAGEMENT\nKeep separate face-up discard piles for the two decks. You may not look through the discards unless you play a card that allows you to! When a deck runs out, reshuffle its discards.\nIn Play: These are the cards on the table in front of you, showing your Race and Class (if any) and the Items you are carrying. Continuing Curses and some other cards also stay on the table after you play them. Cards in play are public information and must be visible to the other players.\n\nmunchkin.game\n6\n\nInterfering With Combat\nYou can interfere with others\u2019 combats in several ways, including: Use a one-shot card. You could help another player by using a one-shot to strengthen their side. Of course, you can \u201caccidentally\u201d strengthen the monster with it, instead. . .\nPlay a monster enhancer. These cards (usually) make a monster stronger .. . and give it more Treasure. You can play these either during your own combats or during someone else's combat.\nAdd a monster from your hand to join the combat, either with a Wandering Monster card or by using the special Undead rule.\nBackstab a player in combat, if you're a Thief.\nCurse them, if you have a Curse card.\n\nREWARDS\nWhen you kill a monster, you get one level per monster, unless the monster card says something else, and you get all its Treasure! Each monster has a Treasure number on the bottom of its card. Draw that many Treasures, modified by any monster enhancers played on it. Draw face-down if you killed the monster alone. Draw face-up, so the whole party can see what you got, if someone helped you, even if they aren't taking any Treasures.

If you have a Princess card, are not already a Princess, and want to become a Princess, just play it in front of you. Keep the Princess card as long as you want, even if you die. You may discard Princess at any time.\nSTEVE JACKSON Games 4,\n\nCHARACTER CREATION\nEveryone starts as a Level | human with no class. (Heh, heh.) Munchkin characters may be either male or female. Your character's sex is the same as your own at the start of the game, unless you declare otherwise.\nLook at your initial eight cards. If you have any Race or Class cards, you may (if you like) play one of each type by placing it in front of you. If you have any usable Items (p. Bhs you may play them by placing them in front of you. If you have any doubt about whether you should play a card, you could read below, or you could just charge ahead and do it.\n\nSTARTING AND FINISHING THE GAME\nDecide who goes first by rolling the dice and arguing about the results and the meaning of this sentence and whether the fact that a word seems to be missing any effect.\nPlay proceeds in turns, each with several phases (see p- 2). When the first player finishes a turn, the player to the left takes a turn, and so on.\nThe first player to reach Level 10 wins . . . but you must reach Level 10 by killing a monster, unless a card specifically allows you to win another way.\n\nCHARACTER STATS\nEach character is basically a collection of weapons, armor, and magic items, with three stats: Level, Race, and Class. For instance, you might describe your character as a \u201cLevel 8 Elf Wizard with Boots of Butt-Kicking, a Staff of Napalm, and the Kneepads of Allure.\u201d Level: This is a measure of how generally buff and studly you are. When the rules or cards refer to your Level, capitalized, they mean this number. You gain a level when you kill a monster, or when a card says that you do. You can also sell Items to buy levels (see Items). You lose a level when a card says you do. Your Level can never go below 1. However, your combat strength can be negative, if you get hit by a Curse or suffer some other kind of penalty.\nClass: Characters may be Warriors, Wizards, Thieves, or Clerics. If you have no Class card in front of you, you have no class. Yeah, I know, we did that one already.\nEach Class has special abilities, shown on the cards. You gain the abilities of a Class the moment you play its card in front of you, and lose them as soon as you discard that card. Some Class abilities are powered by discards. You may discard any card, in play or in your hand, to power a special ability.\nSee the Class cards for when abilities can be used. Note that a Thief cannot steal while he or the target is fighting - and as soon as a monster is revealed, the fight is on!\nYou can discard a Class card at any time, even in combat: \u201cI don't wanna be a wizard anymore.\u201d When you discard a Class card, you become classless until you play another Class card.\nYou may not belong to more than one class at once unless you play the Super Munchkin card.\nRace: Characters may be Humans, Elves, Dwarves, or Halflings. If you have no Race card in front of you, you are human.\n\nConflicts Between Cards and Rules\nThis rulesheet gives the general tules. Many cards add special rules, so in most cases when the rulesheet disagrees with a card, follow the card. However, ignore any card effect that might seem to contradict one of the rules listed below unless the card explicitly says it supersedes that rule!\niL Nothing can reduce a player below Level 1, although card effects might reduce a player's or a monster's combat strength (p. 3) below I.\n2. You go up a level after combat only if you Ail a monster.\n3. You cannot collect rewards for defeating a monster (eg., Treasure, levels) in the middle of a combat. You must finish the fight before gaining any rewards.\n4. You must killa monster to reach Level 10, and you cannot force another player to help you do it.\nAny other disputes should be settled by loud arguments, with the owner of the game having the last word. You could also read the Munchkin FAQ and errata pages at munchkin.game, or start a discussion at forums.sjgames.com/, munchkin . . . unless it\u2019s more fun to argue.\n\nSTEVE JACKSON GAMES\nYour Hand: Cards in your hand are not in play.

In that case, the Hireling is of the sex, if any, shown on its card. It should be pretty obvious, even to your munchkin players, which are male, which are female, and which have no sex at all.\nRobots never have a gender, even if their card text uses masculine pronouns. Ralph the Wonder Dog used to be male, but we took him to the vet.\nIf you ever want to change the sex of a Hireling, you need the Sex Change Potion.\n\nHirelings and Cheating\nA Cheat! card can be used to give you an extra Hireling, or to let a Hireling carry an item he normally could not (but why not just use the card on yourself?).

Most of these are used during combat to strengthen the munchkins or the monsters, and may be played from your hand or from the table. Some have other effects, however, so read the card carefully! Discard these cards as soon as the combat is over or their effect is resolved.\nOne-shot Items with a Gold Piece value may be sold for levels, just like other Items.\n\nOTHER TREASURES\nOther Treasure cards (like Go Up a Level cards) are not Items. Most of these cards say when they can be played, and whether they stay in play or are discarded. A couple of specific examples: Go Upa Level cards may be played on yourself or any other player at any time, even during combat. Discard them once they are played.

You must defeat their combined combat strengths. Any special abilities, such as forcing you to fight with your Level only, apply to the entire fight. If you have the right cards, you can eliminate one monster from the combat and fight the other(s) normally, but you cannot choose to fight one and Run Away from the other(s). If you eliminate one monster, but then run from the other(s), you don\u2019t get any levels or Treasure!\n\nFaster Play Rules\nFor a faster game, you can adda \u201cphase 0\u201d called Listen At The Door. At the start of your turn before doing anything else, draw a face-down Door card, which you may play or not. Then arrange cards and Kick Open The Door normally, If you Loot The Room, draw a face-down Treasure, not a Door.\nUsually, a Curse affects its victim immediately (if it can) and is then discarded. However, some Curses give a penalty later in the game or have a continuing effect. Keep these cards until you get rid of the Curse or the penalty takes effect. (Curse cards you keep as a reminder may not be discarded to power Class or Race abilities. Nice try!) You can also allow shared victories \u2014 if a player reaches Level 10 in a fight where you are the helper, you also win the game, no matter what Note: If someone plays a \u201cyour next combat\u201d Curse on you while you are Level you are.\nin combat, it counts in that combat! The same is true for a \u201cyour next turn\u201d Curse played during your turn.\nGame Design by Steve Jackson @ Illustrated by John Kovalic President/Editor-in-Chief: Steve Jackson @ Chief Executive Officer: Philip Reed @ Chief Operating Officer: Susan Bueno @ Chief Creative Officer: Sam Mitschke Munchkin Line Editor: Andrew Hackard @ Production Manager: Sabrina Gonzalez @ Production Artists: Alex Fernandez and Sabrina Gonzalez Project Manager: Darryll Silva @ Operations Manager: Randy Scheunemann @ Director of Sales: Ross Jepson Playtesters: Steve Brinich, Moe Chapman, Paul Chapman, Alain Dawson, Jessie D. Foster, Russell Godwin, Al Griego, Susan Rati, Kat Robertson, and Monica Stephens.\nOur deepest thanks to the hundreds, or thousands, or maybe millions of munchkins who have played, told their friends, and suggested new cards since the first release of Munchkin. We love you all and you scare us deeply!\n\nSTEEDS\nDear to a munchkin\u2019s heart (as of now) is his mighty Steed. Because, of course, it gives bonuses. Steeds are found in the Door deck.\nNo player can have more than one Steed except by using a Cheat! card.\nSteeds are Items, and follow normal Item rules. Anything that affects an Item can affect a Steed.\nSteeds carry themselves. A Steed is \u201cBig,\u201d but it does not count against the number of Big items you can carry (in fact, some let you carry more Big things). The \u201cBig\u201d designation on Steeds is to control what Traps and Curses affect them, and to keep Thieves from pocketing them and walking off.\nThere are a few Items that specifically enhance Steeds. Steeds cannot use Items unless the Item card specifically says so, and Item Enhancers don\u2019t affect Steed-enhancing Items.\nIf a Steed has a bonus or penalty to Run Away, that replaces the bonus of the rider. An Elf normally has a bonus to Run Away, but he has a penalty if he is riding the Turtle Steed! If your Steed gives you a penalty to Run Away, you may discard the Steed before you roll to flee. You don\u2019t suffer the penalty, but the card goes to the discard pile.\n\nTreating Steeds as Monsters\nA player who draws a face-up Steed may choose to treat it as a monster instead. In that case, its Level is equal to twice the combat bonus at the top of the card, and defeating it is good for one Treasure and one level. Monster Enhancers may be played on Steeds being fought as monsters, and have their normal effects. The Bad Stuff for any Steed attacked as a monster is \u201cLose a level.\u201d\n\nHIRELINGS\nHirelings, Sidekicks, Monks, Minions, Comrades, and Allies are all the same for the purposes of these rules.\nHirelings are found in Door decks in some sets, Treasures in others. (In this set, they're Doors.) You can play a Hireling at any time, even in combat, as long as you have only one Hireling in play at a time. If you draw a face-up Hireling, you may put it in your hand if you cannot (or don\u2019t want to) put it in play. You may discard a Hireling at any time.\nA Hireling is not an Item unless it has a price on it. You may only trade Hirelings that have a Gold Piece value.\nA Hireling can sacrifice himself for you. If you lose a fight, then instead of rolling to run away, you may discard one Hireling and anything he is carrying. You automatically escape from all monsters in the fight, even if a monster card says escape is impossible. If someone was helping you in the fight, YOU decide whether that person automatically escapes as well, or must roll to escape.\nSome Hirelings give you extra Hands, or let you carry an extra Big or Complex item. In this case, the Hireling does not actually have any Items . . . he merely increases your own abilities. If something happens to the Hireling, your Items are not affected.\nOther Hirelings, like the Elf Hireling from this set, can specifically carry and use an Item themselves; in some cases, a Hireling can use an Item you cannot use for yourself. The Items a Hireling carries count for you and are affected by Traps, Curses, and Bad Stuff as though you were carrying them yourself.\ne If your Hireling sacrifices himself to save you, any Items he was carrying are lost.\ne If your Hireling is killed, you loot the body yourself and keep the Items."}, {"query": "When can I play a Super Munchkin card?", "answer": "You can play a Super Munchkin card whenever it is legal to play a Class card.", "result": "You can play a Super Munchkin card when it is legal to play a Class card and you have an appropriate Class card to attach it to.", "context": "SUPER MUNCHKIN AND HALF-BREED\nThese cards may be played whenever it is legal to play a Class or Race, as long as you have an appropriate card (Class for Super Munchkin, Race for Half-Breed) to attach it to.

If the Class has an ability that has a cost, however, you must still pay it - you aren't that Super! If you play Super Munchkin while you have two Classes, you have all the normal advantages and disadvantages of both Classes. (All of the above is also true for Half-Breed, just for Races.)\n\nITEM ENHANCERS\nSome cards are Item Enhancers. These must be played on an Item you already have in play; they cannot be played by themselves. They add to the combat bonus of the Item or give the Item new abilities.

Most of these are used during combat to strengthen the munchkins or the monsters, and may be played from your hand or from the table. Some have other effects, however, so read the card carefully!

Most of these cards say when they can be played, and whether they stay in play or are discarded.

Reducing someone's abilities just as they think they have killed a monster is a lot of fun.\nIf a Curse can apply to more than one Item, the victim decides which Item is lost & or Cursed.

Rules version 1.6 (January 2013).\n\nmunchkin.game\n\n#2, BONUS\n\nCHARACTER STATS\nEach character is basically a collection of weapons, armor, and magic items, with three stats: Level, Race, and Class. For instance, you might describe your character as a \u201cLevel 8 Elf Wizard with Boots of Butt-Kicking, a Staff of Napalm, and the Kneepads of Allure.\u201d Level: This is a measure of how generally buff and studly you are. When the rules or cards refer to your Level, capitalized, they mean this number. You gain a level when you kill a monster, or when a card says that you do. You can also sell Items to buy levels (see Items). You lose a level when a card says you do. Your Level can never go below 1. However, your combat strength can be negative, if you get hit by a Curse or suffer some other kind of penalty.\nClass: Characters may be Warriors, Wizards, Thieves, or Clerics. If you have no Class card in front of you, you have no class. Yeah, I know, we did that one already.\nEach Class has special abilities, shown on the cards. You gain the abilities of a Class the moment you play its card in front of you, and lose them as soon as you discard that card. Some Class abilities are powered by discards. You may discard any card, in play or in your hand, to power a special ability.\nSee the Class cards for when abilities can be used. Note that a Thief cannot steal while he or the target is fighting - and as soon as a monster is revealed, the fight is on!\nYou can discard a Class card at any time, even in combat: \u201cI don't wanna be a wizard anymore.\u201d When you discard a Class card, you become classless until you play another Class card.\nYou may not belong to more than one class at once unless you play the Super Munchkin card.\nRace: Characters may be Humans, Elves, Dwarves, or Halflings. If you have no Race card in front of you, you are human.\n\nWhen You May Take Actions\nYou may perform these actions at any time: & Discard a Class or Race.\n& Play a Go Up a Level or Hireling. Play a Curse.\nYou may perform these actions at any time, as long as you are not in combat: Trade an Item with another player (the other player may not be in combat, either).\ny Change which Items you have equipped.\nPlay a card that you have just received (some cards may be played even during combat; see above).\nYou may perform these actions on your own turn: 3 Play a new Class or Race card (at any time).\nwe Sell Items for levels (except when you are in combat).

You may trade at any time except when you or your trading partner are in combat \u2014 in fact, the best time to trade is when it\u2019s not your turn, Any Ttem you receive in a trade must remain in play. You may also give Items away without a trade, to bribe other players - \u201cTl give you my Flaming Armor if you won't help Bob fight that dragon!\u201d You may show your hand to others. Like we could stop you. Selling Items for Levels: At any point during your turn except during combat or Running Away, you may discard Items worth a total of at least 1,000 Gold Pieces and immediately go up one level. (\u201cNo Value\u201d cards are the same as zero Gold Pieces.) If you discard (for instance) 1,100 Gold Pieces worth, you don't get change. But if you can manage 2,000 worth, you can go up two levels at once, and so on. You may sell Items from your hand as well as those you are carrying. You may not sell Items to go to Level 10.\n\nCHARACTER CREATION\nEveryone starts as a Level | human with no class. (Heh, heh.) Munchkin characters may be either male or female. Your character's sex is the same as your own at the start of the game, unless you declare otherwise.\nLook at your initial eight cards.

If you have any doubt about whether you should play a card, you could read below, or you could just charge ahead and do it.\n\nSTARTING AND FINISHING THE GAME\nDecide who goes first by rolling the dice and arguing about the results and the meaning of this sentence and whether the fact that a word seems to be missing any effect.\nPlay proceeds in turns, each with several phases (see p- 2). When the first player finishes a turn, the player to the left takes a turn, and so on.\nThe first player to reach Level 10 wins . . . but you must reach Level 10 by killing a monster, unless a card specifically allows you to win another way.\n\n\"ONE-SHOT\u201d TREASURES\nA Treasure card that says \u201cUsable once only\u201d is often called a \u201cone-shot\u201d Treasure.

You may discard a Hireling at any time.\nA Hireling is not an Item unless it has a price on it. You may only trade Hirelings that have a Gold Piece value.\nA Hireling can sacrifice himself for you. If you lose a fight, then instead of rolling to run away, you may discard one Hireling and anything he is carrying. You automatically escape from all monsters in the fight, even if a monster card says escape is impossible. If someone was helping you in the fight, YOU decide whether that person automatically escapes as well, or must roll to escape.\nSome Hirelings give you extra Hands, or let you carry an extra Big or Complex item. In this case, the Hireling does not actually have any Items . . . he merely increases your own abilities. If something happens to the Hireling, your Items are not affected.\nOther Hirelings, like the Elf Hireling from this set, can specifically carry and use an Item themselves; in some cases, a Hireling can use an Item you cannot use for yourself. The Items a Hireling carries count for you and are affected by Traps, Curses, and Bad Stuff as though you were carrying them yourself.\ne If your Hireling sacrifices himself to save you, any Items he was carrying are lost.\ne If your Hireling is killed, you loot the body yourself and keep the Items.\n\ne If your Hireling sacrifices himself to save you, any Items he was carrying are lost.\ne If your Hireling is killed, you loot the body yourself and keep the Items.\ne If your Hireling is taken away by a Trap/Curse, by Bad Stuff, or by a change in loyalty, the Items go with him!

(Penalties to monsters are still considered enhancers.) They also affect the number of Treasures the monsters are worth. monster enhancers may be played by any player during any combat.\nAll enhancers on a single monster add together. If there are multiple monsters in a combat, the person who plays each enhancer must choose which monster it applies to.\nException: Anything that enhances a monster also enhances its Mate . . . if Ancient, Enraged, and Mate are played ona single monster, in any order, you are facing an Ancient Enraged monster and its Ancient Enraged Mate.\n\nGood luck .. .\n\nFIGHTING MULTIPLE MONSTERS\nSome cards (such as Wandering Monster) allow your rivals to send other monsters to join the fight. You must defeat their combined combat strengths. Any special abilities, such as forcing you to fight with your Level only, apply to the entire fight. If you have the right cards, you can eliminate one monster from the combat and fight the other(s) normally, but you cannot choose to fight one and Run Away from the other(s). If you eliminate one monster, but then run from the other(s), you don\u2019t get any levels or Treasure!\n\nCURSES\nIf drawn face-up during the Kick Open The Door phase, Curse cards apply to the person who drew them. If acquired some other way, such as by Looting The Room, Curse cards go into your hand and may be played on any player at any time. Reducing someone's abilities just as they think they have killed a monster is a lot of fun.\nIf a Curse can apply to more than one Item, the victim decides which Item is lost & or Cursed. OO Ifa Curse applies to something you don't have, ignore it. For instance, if you draw Lose Your Armor and you have no Armor, nothing happens; discard the card.

(Sucker.)\nIf you defeat a monster by nonlethal means, you do not get a level and you may or may not get the Treasure, depending on the method.\nTreasure cards can be played as soon as you get them, even if you are the helper.\n\nMUNCHKIN brings you the essence of the dungeon-crawling experience . .. without all that messy roleplaying!\nThis game includes 168 cards, one six-sided die, and these rules. Three to six can play. You will need 10 tokens (coins, poker chips, whatever - or any gadget that counts to 10) for each player.\n\nSETUP\nDivide the cards into the Door deck and the Treasure deck. Shuffle both decks. Deal four cards from each deck to each player.\n\nCARD MANAGEMENT\nKeep separate face-up discard piles for the two decks. You may not look through the discards unless you play a card that allows you to!

These abilities do not work if you are fighting for the win - and if you force someone to help and then the fight becomes one for the win, your helper gets to back out without penalty. However, if you voluntarily help someone, you don't get to back out just because they're about to win the game \u2014 so pay attention!\n\n\"ONE-SHOT\u201d TREASURES\nA Treasure card that says \u201cUsable once only\u201d is often called a \u201cone-shot\u201d Treasure. Most of these are used during combat to strengthen the munchkins or the monsters, and may be played from your hand or from the table. Some have other effects, however, so read the card carefully! Discard these cards as soon as the combat is over or their effect is resolved.\nOne-shot Items with a Gold Piece value may be sold for levels, just like other Items.\n\nOTHER TREASURES\nOther Treasure cards (like Go Up a Level cards) are not Items. Most of these cards say when they can be played, and whether they stay in play or are discarded. A couple of specific examples: Go Upa Level cards may be played on yourself or any other player at any time, even during combat. Discard them once they are played. Exception: You cannot play a Go Up a Level card to give a player the winning level!\nHireling may be played at any time, on any turn. You cannot give a Hireling an Item to carry while you are in combat, however.\n\nASKING FOR HELP\nIfyoucannotwinacombatonyourown,you mayaskanyotherplayer to help you. Ifhe refuses, you may ask another player, and so on, until they all turn you down or someone helps. Only one player can help you, adding their combat strength to yours. Anyone can play cards to affect your combat, however!\nYou'll probably have to bribe someone to help. You may offer your helper any Item(s) you are currently carrying, or any number of the Treasure cards the monster has. If you offer part of the monster's Treasure, you must agree whether they pick first, or you pick first, or whatever. You may also offer to play any cards from your hand that you legally could, such as Go Up a Level cards, on your helper.\nThe special abilities or vulnerabilities of the monster also apply to your helper, and vice versa. For instance, if a Warrior helps you, you will win if your combined total ties that of the monster, and your helper can Berserk and discard cards to add their his combat strength (but only once per combat, not once per monster). If you are facing the Wannabe Vampire and a Cleric helps you, they can chase it away automatically. But if you are facing the Drooling Slime and an Elf helps you, the monster's combat strength is increased by 4 (unless you, too, are an Elf and the monster's combat strength has already been increased).\nIf someone successfully helps you kill the monster, discard it, draw Treasures (see Rewards, below), and follow any special instructions on the monster card. You level up for each slain monster. Your helper does not go up any levels . . . unless the helper is an Elf, in which case they gain one level for each monster slain. You draw the Treasure cards, even if it was your helper\u2019s special ability that defeated the monster, and distribute them according to the agreement you reached.\n\nCOMBAT\nTo fight a monster, compare its combat strength to yours. Combat strength is the total of Level plus all modifiers - positive or negative - given by Items and other cards. If the monster's combat strength is equal to yours, or greater, you lose the combat and must Run Away (see p. 5). If your combat strength totals more than the monster's \u2014 note that monsters win ties! \u2014 you kill it and goupa level (two levels for some big monsters). You'll also get the number of Treasures shown on its card.\nSometimes a card will let you get rid of the monster without killing it. This is still \u201cwinning,\u201d but you don't get a level. Unless the ability says otherwise, you don\u2019t get the Treasures, either. If the last monster is removed from a combat, it ends instantly.\nSome monster cards have special powers that affect combat \u2014 a bonus against a Race or Class, for instance. Be sure to check these!\nYou and the other players may play one-shot Treasures or use Class or Race abilities to help or harm you in your combat. Some Door cards may also be played into a combat, such as monster enhancers (see below).\nIf you kill a monster (or monsters!), discard the monster(s) and any other cards played, and claim your rewards. But note: someone may play a hostile card on you, or use a special power, just as you think you have won. When you kill a monster, you must wait a reasonable time, defined as about 2.6 seconds, for anyone else to speak up. After that, you have really killed the monster, and you really get the level(s) and Treasures, though they can still whine and argue."}, {"query": "Can I play a Go Up a Level card on another player?", "answer": "Yes.", "result": "Yes, you can play a Go Up a Level card on another player.", "context": "\"ONE-SHOT\u201d TREASURES\nA Treasure card that says \u201cUsable once only\u201d is often called a \u201cone-shot\u201d Treasure.

(Heh, heh.) Munchkin characters may be either male or female. Your character's sex is the same as your own at the start of the game, unless you declare otherwise.\nLook at your initial eight cards.

When the first player finishes a turn, the player to the left takes a turn, and so on.\nThe first player to reach Level 10 wins . . . but you must reach Level 10 by killing a monster, unless a card specifically allows you to win another way.\n\nCHARACTER STATS\nEach character is basically a collection of weapons, armor, and magic items, with three stats: Level, Race, and Class. For instance, you might describe your character as a \u201cLevel 8 Elf Wizard with Boots of Butt-Kicking, a Staff of Napalm, and the Kneepads of Allure.\u201d Level: This is a measure of how generally buff and studly you are. When the rules or cards refer to your Level, capitalized, they mean this number. You gain a level when you kill a monster, or when a card says that you do. You can also sell Items to buy levels (see Items). You lose a level when a card says you do. Your Level can never go below 1. However, your combat strength can be negative, if you get hit by a Curse or suffer some other kind of penalty.\nClass: Characters may be Warriors, Wizards, Thieves, or Clerics. If you have no Class card in front of you, you have no class. Yeah, I know, we did that one already.\nEach Class has special abilities, shown on the cards. You gain the abilities of a Class the moment you play its card in front of you, and lose them as soon as you discard that card. Some Class abilities are powered by discards. You may discard any card, in play or in your hand, to power a special ability.\nSee the Class cards for when abilities can be used. Note that a Thief cannot steal while he or the target is fighting - and as soon as a monster is revealed, the fight is on!\nYou can discard a Class card at any time, even in combat: \u201cI don't wanna be a wizard anymore.\u201d When you discard a Class card, you become classless until you play another Class card.\nYou may not belong to more than one class at once unless you play the Super Munchkin card.\nRace: Characters may be Humans, Elves, Dwarves, or Halflings.

You may not alter the status of your Items during a combat or while running away.\nAnyone can carry any Item (except for extra Big items; see below), but you may equip only one Headgear, one suit of Armor, one pair of Footgear, and two \u201cI Hand\u201d Items (or one \u201c2 Hands\u201d Item) . . . unless you have a card that lets you ignore these limits, such as Hireling or Cheat!, or unless one of the cards says otherwise. If you are carrying two Headgear cards, for instance, you can equip only one of them at a time.\nLikewise, some Items have restrictions: for instance, the Mace of Sharpness can only be wielded by a Cleric. Its bonus only counts for someone who is, at the moment, a Cleric.\nYou cannot discard Item cards \u201cjust because.\u201d You may sell Items for a level, trade Items with other players, or give an Item to another player who wants it (see below). You may discard Items to power certain Class and Race abilities. And a Curse or a monster's Bad Stuff (see p. 5) may force you to get rid of something!\nBig Items: You may carry any number of Small items, but only one Big one. (Any item not marked Big is considered Small.) You may not discard one Big item to play another; you must sell the first Item, trade it, lose it to a Curse or Bad Stuff, or discard it to power a Class or Race ability.\n\nWhen You May Take Actions\nYou may perform these actions at any time: & Discard a Class or Race.\n& Play a Go Up a Level or Hireling. Play a Curse.\nYou may perform these actions at any time, as long as you are not in combat: Trade an Item with another player (the other player may not be in combat, either).\ny Change which Items you have equipped.\nPlay a card that you have just received (some cards may be played even during combat; see above).\nYou may perform these actions on your own turn: 3 Play a new Class or Race card (at any time).\nwe Sell Items for levels (except when you are in combat).

The rules for Classes, above, also apply to Races.\nYou may not belong to more than one race at once unless you play the Half-Breed card.\n\nWhen You May Take Actions\nYou may perform these actions at any time: & Discard a Class or Race.\n& Play a Go Up a Level or Hireling.

Play an Item (most Items cannot be played during combat, but some one-shot Items can; see p- 3).\n\nCHARACTER STATS\nEach character is basically a collection of weapons, armor, and magic items, with three stats: Level, Race, and Class. For instance, you might describe your character as a \u201cLevel 8 Elf Wizard with Boots of Butt-Kicking, a Staff of Napalm, and the Kneepads of Allure.\u201d Level: This is a measure of how generally buff and studly you are. When the rules or cards refer to your Level, capitalized, they mean this number. You gain a level when you kill a monster, or when a card says that you do. You can also sell Items to buy levels (see Items). You lose a level when a card says you do. Your Level can never go below 1. However, your combat strength can be negative, if you get hit by a Curse or suffer some other kind of penalty.\nClass: Characters may be Warriors, Wizards, Thieves, or Clerics. If you have no Class card in front of you, you have no class. Yeah, I know, we did that one already.\nEach Class has special abilities, shown on the cards. You gain the abilities of a Class the moment you play its card in front of you, and lose them as soon as you discard that card. Some Class abilities are powered by discards. You may discard any card, in play or in your hand, to power a special ability.\nSee the Class cards for when abilities can be used. Note that a Thief cannot steal while he or the target is fighting - and as soon as a monster is revealed, the fight is on!\nYou can discard a Class card at any time, even in combat: \u201cI don't wanna be a wizard anymore.\u201d When you discard a Class card, you become classless until you play another Class card.\nYou may not belong to more than one class at once unless you play the Super Munchkin card.\nRace: Characters may be Humans, Elves, Dwarves, or Halflings. If you have no Race card in front of you, you are human.\n\nSUPER MUNCHKIN AND HALF-BREED\nThese cards may be played whenever it is legal to play a Class or Race, as long as you have an appropriate card (Class for Super Munchkin, Race for Half-Breed) to attach it to. You cannot have more than one of the same Class or Race card in play at once.\nIf you play Super Munchkin with one Class, you get all the advantages of being that Class (the ability to equip Class-only Items, monsters with penalties against that Class suffer those penalties) and none of the disadvantages (you can equip Items forbidden to that Class, and monsters do not get bonuses because of your Class). If the Class has an ability that has a cost, however, you must still pay it - you aren't that Super! If you play Super Munchkin while you have two Classes, you have all the normal advantages and disadvantages of both Classes. (All of the above is also true for Half-Breed, just for Races.)\n\nConflicts Between Cards and Rules\nThis rulesheet gives the general tules. Many cards add special rules, so in most cases when the rulesheet disagrees with a card, follow the card. However, ignore any card effect that might seem to contradict one of the rules listed below unless the card explicitly says it supersedes that rule!\niL Nothing can reduce a player below Level 1, although card effects might reduce a player's or a monster's combat strength (p. 3) below I.\n2. You go up a level after combat only if you Ail a monster.\n3. You cannot collect rewards for defeating a monster (eg., Treasure, levels) in the middle of a combat. You must finish the fight before gaining any rewards.\n4. You must killa monster to reach Level 10, and you cannot force another player to help you do it.\nAny other disputes should be settled by loud arguments, with the owner of the game having the last word. You could also read the Munchkin FAQ and errata pages at munchkin.game, or start a discussion at forums.sjgames.com/, munchkin . . . unless it\u2019s more fun to argue.\n\nSTEVE JACKSON GAMES\nYour Hand: Cards in your hand are not in play. They don\u2019t help you, but they can\u2019t be taken away except by cards that specifically affect \u201cyour hand.\u201d At the end of your turn, you may have no more than five cards in your hand (see Charity, p- 2).\nCards in play may not be returned to your hand - they must be discarded or traded if you want to get rid of them."}]
