But if you are facing the Drooling Slime and an Elf helps you, the monster's combat strength is increased by 4 (unless you, too, are an Elf and the monster's combat strength has already been increased).\nIf someone successfully helps you kill the monster, discard it, draw Treasures (see Rewards, below), and follow any special instructions on the monster card. You level up for each slain monster. Your helper does not go up any levels . . . unless the helper is an Elf, in which case they gain one level for each monster slain. You draw the Treasure cards, even if it was your helper\u2019s special ability that defeated the monster, and distribute them according to the agreement you reached.\n---\n\n\n---\nNAME: munchkin_rules/munchkin_rules-1.pdf\nPAGE: 3\nPASSAGE:\nCOMBAT\nTo fight a monster, compare its combat strength to yours. Combat strength is the total of Level plus all modifiers - positive or negative - given by Items and other cards. If the monster's combat strength is equal to yours, or greater, you lose the combat and must Run Away (see p. 5). If your combat strength totals more than the monster's \u2014 note that monsters win ties! \u2014 you kill it and goupa level (two levels for some big monsters). You'll also get the number of Treasures shown on its card.\nSometimes a card will let you get rid of the monster without killing it. This is still \u201cwinning,\u201d but you don't get a level. Unless the ability says otherwise, you don\u2019t get the Treasures, either. If the last monster is removed from a combat, it ends instantly.\nSome monster cards have special powers that affect combat \u2014 a bonus against a Race or Class, for instance. Be sure to check these!\nYou and the other players may play one-shot Treasures or use Class or Race abilities to help or harm you in your combat. Some Door cards may also be played into a combat, such as monster enhancers (see below).\nIf you kill a monster (or monsters!), discard the monster(s) and any other cards played, and claim your rewards. But note: someone may play a hostile card on you, or use a special power, just as you think you have won. When you kill a monster, you must wait a reasonable time, defined as about 2.6 seconds, for anyone else to speak up. After that, you have really killed the monster, and you really get the level(s) and Treasures, though they can still whine and argue.\n---\n\n\n---\nNAME: munchkin_rules/munchkin_rules-1.pdf\nPAGE: 4\nPASSAGE:\nInterfering With Combat\nYou can interfere with others\u2019 combats in several ways, including: Use a one-shot card. You could help another player by using a one-shot to strengthen their side. Of course, you can \u201caccidentally\u201d strengthen the monster with it, instead. . .\nPlay a monster enhancer. These cards (usually) make a monster stronger .. . and give it more Treasure. You can play these either during your own combats or during someone else's combat.\nAdd a monster from your hand to join the combat, either with a Wandering Monster card or by using the special Undead rule.\nBackstab a player in combat, if you're a Thief.\nCurse them, if you have a Curse card.\n\nREWARDS\nWhen you kill a monster, you get one level per monster, unless the monster card says something else, and you get all its Treasure! Each monster has a Treasure number on the bottom of its card. Draw that many Treasures, modified by any monster enhancers played on it. Draw face-down if you killed the monster alone. Draw face-up, so the whole party can see what you got, if someone helped you, even if they aren't taking any Treasures. (Sucker.)\nIf you defeat a monster by nonlethal means, you do not get a level and you may or may not get the Treasure, depending on the method.\nTreasure cards can be played as soon as you get them, even if you are the helper.\n---\n\n\n---\nNAME: munchkin_rules/munchkin_rules-1.pdf\nPAGE: 4\nPASSAGE:\nA few cards or abilities allow you to compel another player to help you in combat. These abilities do not work if you are fighting for the win - and if you force someone to help and then the fight becomes one for the win, your helper gets to back out without penalty. However, if you voluntarily help someone, you don't get to back out just because they're about to win the game \u2014 so pay attention!\n---\n\n\n---\nNAME: munchkin_rules/munchkin_rules-1.pdf\nPAGE: 5\nPASSAGE:\nExample of Combat, With Numbers and Everything\nAric is a 4th-Level Warrior with the Chainsaw of Bloody Dismemberment (which gives him a +3 to his combat strength).

Aric\u2019s at a7, the Net Troll is at a 10, so Aric is losing.\nAric: | was hoping to save this card . . .\nHe plays the Magic Missile, giving him +5 for this fight. Now his combat strength is 12, beating the Net Troll's 10.\n\nAric: Ha! Net Troll going down!\nSuzan: Not so fast. Now he's Enraged.\nSuzan plays Enraged, adding 5 to the Net Troll\u2019s combat strength. Now Aric is losing, 15 to 12.\n\nAric: Curses!\nSuzan: Want some help? (Suzan is playing a Level 2 Elf with the Boots of Butt-Kicking, so her combat strength is 4. Combined with Aric\u2019s 12, they would have 16, enough to defeat the Net Troll\u2019s 15.)\nAric: And give you a level? Not a chance! I\u2019m Berserking.\nAric uses his Warrior power and discards three cards: Thief and a Wandering Monster from his hand, and Yuppie Water (usable only to help an Elf) from his carried items.

Most of these are used during combat to strengthen the munchkins or the monsters, and may be played from your hand or from the table. Some have other effects, however, so read the card carefully! Discard these cards as soon as the combat is over or their effect is resolved.\nOne-shot Items with a Gold Piece value may be sold for levels, just like other Items.\n\nOTHER TREASURES\nOther Treasure cards (like Go Up a Level cards) are not Items. Most of these cards say when they can be played, and whether they stay in play or are discarded. A couple of specific examples: Go Upa Level cards may be played on yourself or any other player at any time, even during combat. Discard them once they are played.

A Steed is \u201cBig,\u201d but it does not count against the number of Big items you can carry (in fact, some let you carry more Big things). The \u201cBig\u201d designation on Steeds is to control what Traps and Curses affect them, and to keep Thieves from pocketing them and walking off.\nThere are a few Items that specifically enhance Steeds. Steeds cannot use Items unless the Item card specifically says so, and Item Enhancers don\u2019t affect Steed-enhancing Items.\nIf a Steed has a bonus or penalty to Run Away, that replaces the bonus of the rider.

You don\u2019t suffer the penalty, but the card goes to the discard pile.\n\nTreating Steeds as Monsters\nA player who draws a face-up Steed may choose to treat it as a monster instead. In that case, its Level is equal to twice the combat bonus at the top of the card, and defeating it is good for one Treasure and one level. Monster Enhancers may be played on Steeds being fought as monsters, and have their normal effects.

When the rules or cards refer to your Level, capitalized, they mean this number. You gain a level when you kill a monster, or when a card says that you do. You can also sell Items to buy levels (see Items). You lose a level when a card says you do. Your Level can never go below 1.

When your cards are arranged the way you want, go to phase iL (1) Kick Open The Door: Draw one card from the Door deck and turn it face up.\nIf it\u2019s a monster, you must fight it. See Combat, p- 3. If the card is a curse - see Curses, p- Sait applies to you immediately (if it can) and is discarded (unless it has a persistent effect or you keep the card as a reminder of an upcoming effect).\nIf you draw any other card, you may either put it in your hand or play it immediately.\n(2) Look For Trouble/Loot The Room: If you fought a monster in phase IL, skip this phase and go to phase Be If you did NOT draw a monster when you first opened the door, you have two choices: either Look For Trouble or Loot The Room.\nLook For Trouble: Play a monster from your hand and fight it, just as if you had found it when you kicked open the door. Don\u2019t play a monster you can't handle, unless you're sure you can count on getting help (see p- 4)!\nLoot The Room: Draw a second card from the Door deck, face down, and place it in your hand.\n---\n"}, {"query": "How can I get rid of my Class card?", "answer": "You can discard your Class card at any time.", "result": "To get rid of a Class card in Munchkin, you can discard it at any time, even in combat, and the character becomes classless until another Class card is played.", "context": "\n---\nNAME: munchkin_rules/munchkin_rules-1.pdf\nPAGE: 2\nPASSAGE:\nCHARACTER STATS\nEach character is basically a collection of weapons, armor, and magic items, with three stats: Level, Race, and Class. For instance, you might describe your character as a \u201cLevel 8 Elf Wizard with Boots of Butt-Kicking, a Staff of Napalm, and the Kneepads of Allure.\u201d Level: This is a measure of how generally buff and studly you are. When the rules or cards refer to your Level, capitalized, they mean this number. You gain a level when you kill a monster, or when a card says that you do. You can also sell Items to buy levels (see Items). You lose a level when a card says you do. Your Level can never go below 1. However, your combat strength can be negative, if you get hit by a Curse or suffer some other kind of penalty.\nClass: Characters may be Warriors, Wizards, Thieves, or Clerics. If you have no Class card in front of you, you have no class. Yeah, I know, we did that one already.\nEach Class has special abilities, shown on the cards. You gain the abilities of a Class the moment you play its card in front of you, and lose them as soon as you discard that card. Some Class abilities are powered by discards. You may discard any card, in play or in your hand, to power a special ability.\nSee the Class cards for when abilities can be used. Note that a Thief cannot steal while he or the target is fighting - and as soon as a monster is revealed, the fight is on!\nYou can discard a Class card at any time, even in combat: \u201cI don't wanna be a wizard anymore.\u201d When you discard a Class card, you become classless until you play another Class card.\nYou may not belong to more than one class at once unless you play the Super Munchkin card.\n---\n\n\n---\nNAME: munchkin_rules/munchkin_rules-1.pdf\nPAGE: 3\nPASSAGE:\nITEMS\nMost Treasures are Items. Items have a Gold Piece value. \u201cNo Value\u201d is equivalent to zero Gold Pieces, and a \u201cNo Value\u201d card is considered an Item.\nAll Items you have in play are considered \u201ccarried.\u201d Items that are actually giving you a bonus are \u201cequipped.\u201d You should indicate Items that are not equipped by turning the cards sideways. You may not alter the status of your Items during a combat or while running away.\nAnyone can carry any Item (except for extra Big items; see below), but you may equip only one Headgear, one suit of Armor, one pair of Footgear, and two \u201cI Hand\u201d Items (or one \u201c2 Hands\u201d Item) . . . unless you have a card that lets you ignore these limits, such as Hireling or Cheat!, or unless one of the cards says otherwise. If you are carrying two Headgear cards, for instance, you can equip only one of them at a time.\nLikewise, some Items have restrictions: for instance, the Mace of Sharpness can only be wielded by a Cleric. Its bonus only counts for someone who is, at the moment, a Cleric.\nYou cannot discard Item cards \u201cjust because.\u201d You may sell Items for a level, trade Items with other players, or give an Item to another player who wants it (see below). You may discard Items to power certain Class and Race abilities. And a Curse or a monster's Bad Stuff (see p. 5) may force you to get rid of something!\nBig Items: You may carry any number of Small items, but only one Big one. (Any item not marked Big is considered Small.) You may not discard one Big item to play another; you must sell the first Item, trade it, lose it to a Curse or Bad Stuff, or discard it to power a Class or Race ability.\n---\n\n\n---\nNAME: munchkin_rules/munchkin_rules-1.pdf\nPAGE: 3\nPASSAGE:\nCOMBAT\nTo fight a monster, compare its combat strength to yours. Combat strength is the total of Level plus all modifiers - positive or negative - given by Items and other cards. If the monster's combat strength is equal to yours, or greater, you lose the combat and must Run Away (see p. 5). If your combat strength totals more than the monster's \u2014 note that monsters win ties! \u2014 you kill it and goupa level (two levels for some big monsters). You'll also get the number of Treasures shown on its card.\nSometimes a card will let you get rid of the monster without killing it. This is still \u201cwinning,\u201d but you don't get a level. Unless the ability says otherwise, you don\u2019t get the Treasures, either. If the last monster is removed from a combat, it ends instantly.\nSome monster cards have special powers that affect combat \u2014 a bonus against a Race or Class, for instance. Be sure to check these!\nYou and the other players may play one-shot Treasures or use Class or Race abilities to help or harm you in your combat. Some Door cards may also be played into a combat, such as monster enhancers (see below).\nIf you kill a monster (or monsters!), discard the monster(s) and any other cards played, and claim your rewards. But note: someone may play a hostile card on you, or use a special power, just as you think you have won. When you kill a monster, you must wait a reasonable time, defined as about 2.6 seconds, for anyone else to speak up. After that, you have really killed the monster, and you really get the level(s) and Treasures, though they can still whine and argue.\n---\n"}, {"query": "When can I discard a Race card?", "answer": "You can discard your Race card at any time.", "result": "I apologize for the confusion. To clarify, in the game of Munchkin, Race cards can be discarded at any time during the game, regardless of the current phase or state of the game. However, there are certain rules and abilities that may affect when a Race card can be discarded.\n\nFor example, some cards may have abilities that allow them to be discarded and then immediately returned to the player's hand, while others may require a specific condition to be met before they can be discarded. Additionally, certain cards may have effects that prevent certain types of cards from being discarded, such as Item cards or Character cards.\n\nIn general, the decision to discard a Race card is up to the player and depends on their strategy and game plan.

You cannot have more than one of the same Class or Race card in play at once.\nIf you play Super Munchkin with one Class, you get all the advantages of being that Class (the ability to equip Class-only Items, monsters with penalties against that Class suffer those penalties) and none of the disadvantages (you can equip Items forbidden to that Class, and monsters do not get bonuses because of your Class). If the Class has an ability that has a cost, however, you must still pay it - you aren't that Super! If you play Super Munchkin while you have two Classes, you have all the normal advantages and disadvantages of both Classes.

(Heh, heh.) Munchkin characters may be either male or female. Your character's sex is the same as your own at the start of the game, unless you declare otherwise.\nLook at your initial eight cards. If you have any Race or Class cards, you may (if you like) play one of each type by placing it in front of you. If you have any usable Items (p. Bhs you may play them by placing them in front of you. If you have any doubt about whether you should play a card, you could read below, or you could just charge ahead and do it.\n\nSTARTING AND FINISHING THE GAME\nDecide who goes first by rolling the dice and arguing about the results and the meaning of this sentence and whether the fact that a word seems to be missing any effect.\nPlay proceeds in turns, each with several phases (see p- 2). When the first player finishes a turn, the player to the left takes a turn, and so on.\nThe first player to reach Level 10 wins . . . but you must reach Level 10 by killing a monster, unless a card specifically allows you to win another way.\n---\n\n\n---\nNAME: munchkin_rules/munchkin_rules-1.pdf\nPAGE: 6\nPASSAGE:\nFaster Play Rules\nFor a faster game, you can adda \u201cphase 0\u201d called Listen At The Door. At the start of your turn before doing anything else, draw a face-down Door card, which you may play or not. Then arrange cards and Kick Open The Door normally, If you Loot The Room, draw a face-down Treasure, not a Door.\nUsually, a Curse affects its victim immediately (if it can) and is then discarded. However, some Curses give a penalty later in the game or have a continuing effect. Keep these cards until you get rid of the Curse or the penalty takes effect. (Curse cards you keep as a reminder may not be discarded to power Class or Race abilities. Nice try!) You can also allow shared victories \u2014 if a player reaches Level 10 in a fight where you are the helper, you also win the game, no matter what Note: If someone plays a \u201cyour next combat\u201d Curse on you while you are Level you are.\nin combat, it counts in that combat! The same is true for a \u201cyour next turn\u201d Curse played during your turn.\nGame Design by Steve Jackson @ Illustrated by John Kovalic President/Editor-in-Chief: Steve Jackson @ Chief Executive Officer: Philip Reed @ Chief Operating Officer: Susan Bueno @ Chief Creative Officer: Sam Mitschke Munchkin Line Editor: Andrew Hackard @ Production Manager: Sabrina Gonzalez @ Production Artists: Alex Fernandez and Sabrina Gonzalez Project Manager: Darryll Silva @ Operations Manager: Randy Scheunemann @ Director of Sales: Ross Jepson Playtesters: Steve Brinich, Moe Chapman, Paul Chapman, Alain Dawson, Jessie D.
