[{"query": "If a monster does not pursue me because my level is too low, can I still loot the room?", "answer": "No, you cannot loot the room.", "result": "Yes, if a monster does not pursue you because your level is too low, you can still loot the room.", "context": "**Turn Phases**\n\n1. **Kick Open The Door**: Draw one card from the Door deck and turn it face up. If it's a monster, you must fight it (refer to Combat on page 3). If the card is a curse, apply it to you immediately (if it can) and discard it (unless it has a persistent effect or you keep the card as a reminder of an upcoming effect). If you draw any other card, you may either put it in your hand or play it immediately.\n\n2. **Look For Trouble/Loot The Room**: \n   - If you fought a monster in phase 1, skip this phase and go to phase 3.\n   - If you did NOT draw a monster when you first opened the door, you have two choices: either Look For Trouble or Loot The Room.\n   - Look For Trouble: Play a monster from your hand and fight it, just as if you had found it when you kicked open the door. Don't play a monster you can't handle, unless you're sure you can count on getting help (see page 4)!\n   - Loot The Room: Draw a second card from the Door deck, face down, and place it in your hand.\n\n3. **Charity**: If you have more than five cards in your hand, you must play enough cards to get you to five or below - for instance, you can play Curses, sell Items from your hand, or play Items to the table. If you cannot reduce your hand to five cards, or do not want to, you must give the excess cards to the player with the lowest Level. If players are tied for lowest, divide the cards as evenly as possible, but it's up to you who gets the bigger set(s) of leftovers. If YOU are the lowest or tied for lowest, just discard the excess. As soon as you are finished with Charity, the next player's turn begins.\n\n**Combat**\n\nTo fight a monster, compare its combat strength to yours. Combat strength is the total of your Level plus all modifiers - positive or negative - given by Items and other cards. If the monster's combat strength is equal to or greater than yours, you lose the combat and must Run Away (see p. 5). If your combat strength totals more than the monster's - remember, monsters win ties! - you kill it and gain a level (two levels for some big monsters). You'll also receive the number of Treasures shown on its card.\n\nSometimes a card will let you get rid of the monster without killing it. This is still \"winning,\" but you don't gain a level. Unless the ability says otherwise, you don't get the Treasures, either. If the last monster is removed from a combat, it ends instantly.\n\nSome monster cards have special powers that affect combat - a bonus against a Race or Class, for instance. Be sure to check these!\n\nYou and the other players may play one-shot Treasures or use Class or Race abilities to help or harm you in your combat. Some Door cards may also be played into a combat, such as monster enhancers (see below).\n\nIf you kill a monster (or monsters!), discard the monster(s) and any other cards played, and claim your rewards. However, be prepared for someone to play a hostile card on you or use a special power just as you think you have won. When you kill a monster, you must wait a reasonable time, defined as about 2.6 seconds, for anyone else to speak up. After that, you have really killed the monster, and you really get the level(s) and Treasures, though they can still whine and argue."}, {"query": "Can I sell items from my hand to go up a level, assuming I can sell 1,000 gold pieces worth?", "answer": "Yes. You can sell items from your hand to go up a level.", "result": "Yes, you can sell items from your hand to go up a level, as long as the total value is at least 1,000 gold pieces.", "context": "## Items and Trading\n\nIf you have more than one item, you must sell them or give them to the lowest-level player(s) who can carry them. If there are still big items left over, discard them.\n\nYou can trade items with other players, but not other cards. Trades can happen at any time, except when you or your trading partner are in combat. The best time to trade is during someone else's turn. Any item you receive in a trade must remain in play.\n\nYou can also give items away as bribes to other players. For example, \"I'll give you my Flaming Armor if you won't help Bob fight that dragon!\"\n\n## Selling Items for Levels\n\nDuring your turn, except during combat or running away, you can discard items worth a total of at least 1,000 gold pieces and immediately go up one level. \"No Value\" cards are equivalent to zero gold pieces. If you can manage 2,000 gold pieces worth of items, you can go up two levels at once, and so on.\n\nYou can sell items from your hand as well as those you are carrying. However, you cannot use item sales to reach level 10.\n\n**ONE-SHOT TREASURES**\n\nA Treasure card with the notation \"Usable once only\" is commonly referred to as a \"one-shot\" Treasure. These are typically used during combat to strengthen the munchkins or the monsters and can be played from your hand or from the table. Some have other effects, so make sure to read the card carefully! Discard these cards as soon as the combat is over or their effect is resolved.\n\nOne-shot Items with a Gold Piece value can be sold for levels, just like other Items.\n\n**OTHER TREASURES**\n\nOther Treasure cards (like Go Up a Level cards) are not Items. Most of these cards indicate when they can be played and whether they stay in play or are discarded. A couple of specific examples:\n\n- Go Up a Level cards can be played on yourself or any other player at any time, even during combat. Discard them once they are played. Note that you cannot play a Go Up a Level card to give a player the winning level!\n- Hireling can be played at any time, on any turn. However, you cannot give a Hireling an Item to carry while you are in combat.\n\nItems are the most common Treasures in Munchkin. They have a Gold Piece value, and a \"No Value\" card is equivalent to zero Gold Pieces. Items that are \"carried\" are those in your possession, while those providing you with a bonus are \"equipped.\" To distinguish between the two, turn the cards sideways for non-equipped items. You cannot alter the status of your Items during combat or while running away.\n\nAny player can carry any Item, except for extra Big items (see below). However, you can equip only one Headgear, one suit of Armor, one pair of Footgear, and two \"I Hand\" or \"2 Hands\" Items. This limit can be bypassed with cards like Hireling or Cheat!, or if a card states otherwise. If you are carrying two Headgear cards, for example, you can equip only one at a time.\n\nSome Items have restrictions, such as the Mace of Sharpness, which can only be wielded by a Cleric. Its bonus only counts for someone who is currently a Cleric.\n\nYou cannot discard Item cards without a valid reason. You may sell, trade, or gift Items to other players, use them to power certain Class and Race abilities, or discard them due to a Curse or a monster's Bad Stuff.\n\nBig Items are limited to one per player. You cannot discard one Big item to play another; you must sell the first Item, trade it, lose it to a Curse or Bad Stuff, or discard it to power a Class or Race ability. All other items not marked as Big are considered Small and can be carried in any number.\n\n## Turn Phases\n\nYour turn begins as soon as the previous player's turn ends. Once you have arranged your cards as desired, proceed to phase 1.\n\n### Phase 1: Kick Open The Door\n\nDraw one card from the Door deck and turn it face up. If it's a monster, you must fight it. Refer to the Combat section on page 3. If the card is a curse, apply it to you immediately (if it can) and discard it (unless it has a persistent effect or you keep the card as a reminder of an upcoming effect). If you draw any other card, you may either add it to your hand or play it immediately.\n\n### Phase 2: Look For Trouble/Loot The Room\n\nIf you fought a monster during phase 1, skip this phase and proceed to phase 3. If you did NOT draw a monster when you first opened the door, you have two choices: either Look For Trouble or Loot The Room.\n\nLook For Trouble: Play a monster from your hand and fight it, just as if you had found it when you kicked open the door. Do not play a monster you cannot handle, unless you are sure you can count on getting help (see page 4)!\n\nLoot The Room: Draw a second card from the Door deck, face down, and place it in your hand.\n\n### Phase 3: Charity\n\nIf you have more than five cards in your hand at the end of phase 2, you must play enough cards to get you to five or below. You can play Curses, sell Items from your hand, or play Items to the table. If you cannot reduce your hand to five cards or do not want to, you must give the excess cards to the player with the lowest Level. If players are tied for lowest, divide the cards as evenly as possible, but it's up to you who gets the bigger set(s) of leftovers. If you are the lowest or tied for lowest, just discard the excess.\n\nAs soon as you are finished with Charity, the next player's turn begins."}, {"query": "If a hireling is removed from play due to Bad Stuff, does the player retain any items the hireling was carrying?", "answer": "No. When a hireling is removed from play due to bad stuff, any items the hireling was carrying are also removed from play.", "result": "If a hireling is removed from play due to Bad Stuff, the player does not retain the items the hireling was carrying.", "context": "Hirelings, Sidekicks, Monks, Minions, Comrades, and Allies are all treated as the same for the purposes of these rules. Hirelings can be found in Door decks in some sets, and Treasures in others (in this set, they're Doors). You can play a Hireling at any time, even during combat, as long as you have only one Hireling in play at a time. If you draw a face-up Hireling, you may put it in your hand if you cannot (or don't want to) put it in play. You may discard a Hireling at any time.\n\nA Hireling is not considered an Item unless it has a price on it. You may only trade Hirelings that have a Gold Piece value.\n\nA Hireling can sacrifice himself for you. If you lose a fight, instead of rolling to run away, you may discard one Hireling and anything he is carrying. You automatically escape from all monsters in the fight, even if a monster card says escape is impossible. If someone was helping you in the fight, you decide whether that person automatically escapes as well, or must roll to escape.\n\nSome Hirelings give you extra Hands or let you carry an extra Big or Complex item. In this case, the Hireling does not actually have any Items; he merely increases your own abilities. If something happens to the Hireling, your Items are not affected.\n\nOther Hirelings, like the Elf Hireling from this set, can specifically carry and use an Item themselves; in some cases, a Hireling can use an Item you cannot use for yourself. The Items a Hireling carries count for you and are affected by Traps, Curses, and Bad Stuff as though you were carrying them yourself.\n\nIf your Hireling sacrifices himself to save you, any Items he was carrying are lost.\n\nIf your Hireling is killed, you loot the body yourself and keep the Items.\n\n# Hireling Items and Monster Bonuses\n\nIn Munchkin, your Hireling can have a significant impact on the game. Here's how their items and bonuses work:\n\n1. **Lost Items**: If your Hireling sacrifices himself to save you, any items he was carrying are lost.\n2. **Looting**: If your Hireling is killed, you loot the body yourself and keep the items.\n3. **Taken Away**: If your Hireling is taken away by a Trap/Curse, Bad Stuff, or a change in loyalty, the items go with him!\n4. **Hireling Bonuses and Penalties**: If you have a Hireling with a specific trait (e.g., Dwarf) and you face a monster that gets a bonus against that trait, the monster gets the bonus against you. However, you can avoid this by discarding the Hireling. Conversely, if a monster has a penalty against a specific trait and you have a Hireling with that trait, you get the penalty reduction.\n\nItems are the most common treasure in Munchkin, and they have a Gold Piece value. Cards with \"No Value\" are equivalent to zero Gold Pieces. Items that are \"carried\" are those in your possession, while \"equipped\" items are providing you with a bonus. Indicate non-equipped items by turning the cards sideways. You cannot alter the status of your items during combat or while running away.\n\nAny player can carry any item (except for extra big items, see below), but you can only equip one headgear, one suit of armor, one pair of footgear, and two \"I Hand\" or one \"2 Hands\" item. Certain cards, such as Hireling or Cheat!, may allow you to ignore these limits, or a card may state otherwise. If you have two headgear cards, for example, you can equip only one at a time.\n\nSome items have restrictions, like the Mace of Sharpness, which can only be wielded by a Cleric. Its bonus only counts for someone who is currently a Cleric.\n\nYou cannot discard item cards without reason. You may sell items, trade them with other players, or give an item to another player who wants it. You may discard items to power certain class and race abilities. A curse or a monster's Bad Stuff may also force you to get rid of an item.\n\nBig items: You can carry any number of small items, but only one big one. Any item not marked as \"Big\" is considered small. You cannot discard one big item to play another; you must sell the first item, trade it, lose it to a curse or Bad Stuff, or discard it to power a class or race ability."}, {"query": "Can I have multiple steeds equipped at the same time?", "answer": "No. You can only have one steed equipped at a time.", "result": "No, you cannot have multiple Steeds equipped at the same time without using a Cheat! card or unless the Steed card itself says otherwise.", "context": "Steeds, beloved by Munchkin players, provide bonuses and are found in the Door deck. A player cannot possess more than one Steed without using a Cheat! card. Steeds are classified as Items and follow the standard Item rules. The \"Big\" designation on Steeds is used to control which Traps and Curses affect them and to prevent Thieves from pocketing them.\n\nThere are specific Items that enhance Steeds, but Steeds cannot use Items unless the card explicitly states so, and Item Enhancers do not affect Steed-enhancing Items. If a Steed provides a bonus or penalty to Run Away, it replaces the rider's bonus. An Elf, for example, has a bonus to Run Away, but would have a penalty if riding the Turtle Steed. If your Steed gives you a penalty to Run Away, you may discard the Steed before rolling to flee, avoiding the penalty but sending the card to the discard pile.\n\nA player can choose to treat a face-up Steed as a monster instead. In this case, its Level is equal to twice the combat bonus at the top of the card, and defeating it grants one Treasure and one level. Monster Enhancers may be played on Steeds being fought as monsters, with their normal effects. If a Steed is attacked as a monster, the consequence is \"Lose a level.\"\n\n# Items\nMost treasures are items, and they have a gold piece value. A \"No Value\" card is equivalent to zero gold pieces, and is considered an item.\n\nAll items you have in play are considered \"carried.\" Items that are actually giving you a bonus are \"equipped.\" To indicate items that are not equipped, turn the cards sideways. You may not alter the status of your items during a combat or while running away.\n\nAnyone can carry any item (except for extra big items; see below), but you may equip only one headgear, one suit of armor, one pair of footgear, and two \"I Hand\" items (or one \"2 Hands\" item)... unless you have a card that lets you ignore these limits, such as Hireling or Cheat!, or unless one of the cards says otherwise. If you are carrying two headgear cards, for instance, you can equip only one of them at a time.\n\nLikewise, some items have restrictions: for instance, the Mace of Sharpness can only be wielded by a Cleric. Its bonus only counts for someone who is, at the moment, a Cleric.\n\nYou cannot discard item cards \"just because.\" You may sell items for a level, trade items with other players, or give an item to another player who wants it (see below). You may discard items to power certain Class and Race abilities. And a Curse or a monster's Bad Stuff (see p. 5) may force you to get rid of something!\n\nBig Items: You may carry any number of small items, but only one big one. (Any item not marked big is considered small.) You may not discard one big item to play another; you must sell the first item, trade it, lose it to a Curse or Bad Stuff, or discard it to power a Class or Race ability.\n\n**Munchkin 2: The Need for Steed**\n\nThis set introduces two unique card types: Hirelings (with more than before) and Steeds (a brand new addition!). It is designed to be played with the original Munchkin game, as well as one or more of the previous expansions. If you choose not to use any other expansions, you'll encounter a plethora of Hirelings and Steeds, but that's not a drawback, as they are all highly munchkin-oriented."}, {"query": "Can I play a Go Up a Level card during combat on my turn?", "answer": "Yes. You can play a Go Up a Level card at any time.", "result": "Yes, you can play a Go Up a Level card during combat on your turn.", "context": "You may perform the following actions at any time:\n\n* Discard a Class or Race.\n* Play a Go Up a Level or Hireling.\n* Play a Curse.\n\nYou may perform these actions at any time, as long as you are not in combat:\n\n* Trade an Item with another player (the other player may not be in combat, either).\n* Change which Items you have equipped.\n* Play a card that you have just received (some cards may be played even during combat; see above).\n\nYou may perform these actions on your own turn:\n\n* Play a new Class or Race card (at any time).\n* Sell Items for levels (except when you are in combat).\n* Play an Item (most Items cannot be played during combat, but some one-shot Items can; see p- 3).\n\n**ONE-SHOT TREASURES**\n\nA \"one-shot\" Treasure card is a card that can only be used once. These cards are often used during combat to enhance the munchkins or monsters and can be played from your hand or from the table. Some have other effects, so make sure to read the card carefully. Discard these cards once the combat is over or their effect is resolved.\n\nOne-shot Items with a Gold Piece value can be sold for levels, just like other Items.\n\n**OTHER TREASURES**\n\nOther Treasure cards, such as Go Up a Level cards, are not Items. Most of these cards specify when they can be played and whether they stay in play or are discarded. A couple of specific examples:\n\n- Go Up a Level cards can be played on yourself or any other player at any time, even during combat. Discard them once they are played. Note that you cannot play a Go Up a Level card to give a player the winning level.\n- Hireling can be played at any time, on any turn. However, you cannot give a Hireling an Item to carry while you are in combat.\n\nInterfering with Combat\n\nThere are several ways to interfere with others' combats, such as:\n\n1. Use a one-shot card: You can help another player by using a one-shot to strengthen their side, or \"accidentally\" strengthen the monster with it.\n2. Play a monster enhancer: These cards (usually) make a monster stronger and give it more Treasure. You can play these either during your own combats or during someone else's combat.\n3. Add a monster from your hand to join the combat, either with a Wandering Monster card or by using the special Undead rule.\n4. Backstab a player in combat, if you're a Thief.\n5. Curse them, if you have a Curse card.\n\nREWARDS\n\nWhen you kill a monster, you gain one level per monster, unless the monster card states otherwise, and you get all its Treasure! Each monster has a Treasure number on the bottom of its card. Draw that many Treasures, modified by any monster enhancers played on it.\n\n1. If you killed the monster alone, draw face-down Treasures.\n2. If someone helped you, draw face-up Treasures, so the whole party can see what you got (even if they aren't taking any Treasures).\n\nNote: If you defeat a monster by nonlethal means, you do not gain a level and may or may not get the Treasure, depending on the method. Treasure cards can be played as soon as you get them, even if you are the helper."}, {"query": "How many players can help me in a combat by adding their combat level?", "answer": "Only one player can help you with their combat level.", "result": "Only one player can help you in a combat by adding their combat strength.", "context": "Asking for Help\n\nIf you cannot win a combat on your own, you may ask another player for assistance. If they refuse, you can continue asking until someone agrees or everyone has declined. Only one player can help you, adding their combat strength to yours. Any player can play cards to affect the combat, however!\n\nTo bribe your helper, you may offer any items you are currently carrying, or any number of the treasure cards the monster possesses. If you offer part of the monster's treasure, you must agree on the order of picking between you and your helper. You may also choose to play any cards from your hand that you are legally allowed to, such as Go Up a Level cards, on your helper.\n\nThe special abilities or vulnerabilities of the monster also apply to your helper, and vice versa. For example, if a Warrior helps you, you will win if your combined total ties that of the monster, and your helper can Berserk and discard cards to add their combat strength (but only once per combat, not once per monster). If you are facing the Wannabe Vampire and a Cleric helps you, they can chase it away automatically. But if you are facing the Drooling Slime and an Elf helps you, the monster's combat strength is increased by 4 (unless you, too, are an Elf and the monster's combat strength has already been increased).\n\nIf someone successfully helps you defeat the monster, discard it, draw treasures (see Rewards, below), and follow any special instructions on the monster card. You level up for each slain monster. Your helper does not go up any levels, unless they are an Elf, in which case they gain one level for each monster slain. You draw the treasure cards, even if it was your helper's special ability that defeated the monster, and distribute them according to the agreement you reached.\n\nInterfering with Combat\n\nThere are several ways to interfere with others' combats, including:\n\n1. Use a one-shot card: You could help another player by using a one-shot to strengthen their side. Alternatively, you could \"accidentally\" strengthen the monster with it.\n2. Play a monster enhancer: These cards (usually) make a monster stronger and give it more Treasure. You can play these either during your own combats or during someone else's combat.\n3. Add a monster from your hand to join the combat: You can do this with a Wandering Monster card or by using the special Undead rule.\n4. Backstab a player in combat, if you're a Thief.\n5. Curse them, if you have a Curse card.\n\nREWARDS\n\nWhen you kill a monster, you gain one level per monster, unless the monster card states otherwise, and you get all its Treasure! Each monster has a Treasure number on the bottom of its card. Draw that many Treasures, modified by any monster enhancers played on it.\n\nIf you killed the monster alone, draw face-down Treasures. If someone helped you, even if they aren't taking any Treasures, draw face-up Treasures so the whole party can see what you got.\n\nIf you defeat a monster by nonlethal means, you do not gain a level and may or may not get the Treasure, depending on the method.\n\nYou can play Treasure cards as soon as you get them, even if you are the helper.\n\nCombat\nTo fight a monster, compare its combat strength to yours. Combat strength is the total of your Level plus all modifiers - positive or negative - given by Items and other cards. If the monster's combat strength is equal to or greater than yours, you lose the combat and must Run Away (see p. 5). If your combat strength totals more than the monster's, you kill it and gain a level (two levels for some big monsters). You'll also receive the number of Treasures shown on its card.\n\nSometimes a card will allow you to get rid of the monster without killing it. This is still considered a win, but you don't gain a level. Unless the ability says otherwise, you don't receive the Treasures, either. If the last monster is removed from a combat, the combat ends immediately.\n\nSome monster cards have special powers that affect combat, such as bonuses against a specific Race or Class. Make sure to check these! You and the other players may play one-shot Treasures or use Class or Race abilities to help or hinder you in your combat. Some Door cards may also be played into a combat, such as monster enhancers (see below).\n\nIf you kill a monster (or monsters!), discard the monster(s) and any other cards played, and claim your rewards. However, be prepared for someone to play a hostile card on you or use a special power just as you think you have won. When you kill a monster, you must wait a reasonable time (about 2.6 seconds) for anyone else to speak up. After that, you have truly killed the monster, and you truly gain the level(s) and Treasures, though they can still whine and argue.\n\nIn Munchkin, certain cards or abilities enable you to coerce another player to assist you in combat. However, these abilities are ineffective when fighting for the victory. If you compel someone to help and the fight becomes a win-or-lose situation, they can withdraw without penalty. On the other hand, if you voluntarily aid someone, you cannot back out just because they are about to win the game - so stay alert!"}, {"query": "Does a player retain their princess card in play if they die?", "answer": "Yes.

The rule on carrying big items states that you can only have one big item, regardless of whether it is equipped or not.", "context": "Items are the most common Treasures in Munchkin. They have a Gold Piece value, and a \"No Value\" card is equivalent to zero Gold Pieces. Items that are in play are considered \"carried.\" Items that are providing you with a bonus are \"equipped.\" To indicate un-equipped Items, turn the cards sideways. You cannot alter the status of your Items during combat or while running away.\n\nAny player can carry any Item, except for extra Big items (see below). However, you can only equip one Headgear, one suit of Armor, one pair of Footgear, and two \"I Hand\" Items (or one \"2 Hands\" Item). This limit can be bypassed if you have a card that allows it, such as Hireling or Cheat!, or if a card specifically states otherwise. If you are carrying two Headgear cards, for example, you can equip only one at a time.\n\nSome Items have restrictions, like the Mace of Sharpness, which can only be wielded by a Cleric. Its bonus only counts for someone who is currently a Cleric.\n\nYou cannot discard Item cards without reason. You can sell Items, trade them with other players, or give an Item to another player who wants it. You can also discard Items to power certain Class and Race abilities. A Curse or a monster's Bad Stuff (see page 5) may force you to get rid of an Item as well.\n\nBig Items: You can carry any number of Small items, but only one Big one. (Any item not marked Big is considered Small.) You cannot discard one Big item to play another; you must sell the first Item, trade it, lose it to a Curse or Bad Stuff, or discard it to power a Class or Race ability.\n\nSteeds are a valuable asset to a Munchkin, providing bonuses and enhancing gameplay. These mighty creatures can be found in the Door deck and are considered Items. Only one Steed can be possessed by a player, unless a Cheat! card is used.\n\nSteeds are classified as \"Big\" items, but do not count towards the limit of Big items a player can carry. This classification is used to control which Traps and Curses affect them and to prevent Thieves from pocketing them.\n\nThere are specific Items that can enhance Steeds, and while Steeds cannot use regular Items, they can use Steed-specific Items. Item Enhancers do not affect Steed-enhancing Items.\n\nSteeds can provide a bonus or penalty to Run Away, which replaces the rider's bonus. For example, an Elf normally has a bonus to Run Away, but if riding the Turtle Steed, they would have a penalty. If a Steed gives a penalty to Run Away, the player can choose to discard the Steed before rolling to flee, avoiding the penalty but sending the card to the discard pile.\n\nIn some cases, a player may choose to treat a Steed as a monster instead of an Item. In this scenario, the Steed's Level is equal to twice the combat bonus at the top of the card, and defeating it grants one Treasure and one level. Monster Enhancers can be played on Steeds being fought as monsters, with their normal effects. If a Steed is attacked as a monster, the consequence is \"Lose a level.\"\n\nIn Munchkin, if a player has multiple Big items due to a certain ability (e.g., Dwarf race) and loses that ability, they must either fix the issue immediately or discard all but one Big item. If it's not their turn or they're not in combat, they can sell the excess Big items, provided they have at least Level Counters: It's Not Cheating, It's Using the Rules!\n\nAdditionally, for iOS and Android users, the Level Counter app is available, which not only assists with gameplay but also offers in-game advantages to make your friends envious. This aligns with the essence of being a munchkin.\n\n# Items and Trading\n\nIf you have more than one Item, you must sell them or give them to the lowest-Level player(s) who can carry them. If any Big items are still left over, discard them.\n\n## Trading Items\n\nYou may trade Items with other players, but not any other cards. You can only trade Items from the table, not from your hand. Trading can occur at any time, except when you or your trading partner are in combat.

You may also give Items away without a trade, to bribe other players.\n\n## Selling Items for Levels\n\nAt any point during your turn, except during combat or Running Away, you may discard Items worth a total of at least 1,000 Gold Pieces and immediately go up one level. (\"No Value\" cards are the same as zero Gold Pieces.) If you discard, for example, 1,100 Gold Pieces worth, you don't get change. But if you can manage 2,000 worth, you can go up two levels at once, and so on. You may sell Items from your hand as well as those you are carrying.\n\nHowever, you may not sell Items to reach Level 10."}, {"query": "What is an item in play but not equipped called?", "answer": "An item in play but not equipped is called a carried item.", "result": "An item in play but not equipped is called a \"carried\" item.", "context": "**ITEMS**\n\nMost Treasures in Munchkin are Items, and Items have a Gold Piece value. A \"No Value\" card is equivalent to zero Gold Pieces and is considered an Item.\n\nAll Items you have in play are considered \"carried.\" Items that are actually giving you a bonus are \"equipped.\" To indicate un-equipped Items, turn the cards sideways. You cannot alter the status of your Items during a combat or while running away.\n\nAnyone can carry any Item (except for extra Big items; see below), but you may equip only one Headgear, one suit of Armor, one pair of Footgear, and two \"I Hand\" Items (or one \"2 Hands\" Item) . . . unless you have a card that lets you ignore these limits, such as Hireling or Cheat!, or unless one of the cards says otherwise. If you are carrying two Headgear cards, for instance, you can equip only one of them at a time.\n\nSome Items have restrictions, such as the Mace of Sharpness, which can only be wielded by a Cleric. Its bonus only counts for someone who is, at the moment, a Cleric.\n\nYou cannot discard Item cards \"just because.\" You may sell Items for a level, trade Items with other players, or give an Item to another player who wants it (see below). You may discard Items to power certain Class and Race abilities. And a Curse or a monster's Bad Stuff (see p. 5) may force you to get rid of something!\n\n**Big Items:** You may carry any number of Small items, but only one Big one. (Any item not marked Big is considered Small.) You may not discard one Big item to play another; you must sell the first Item, trade it, lose it to a Curse or Bad Stuff, or discard it to power a Class or Race ability.\n\n**ONE-SHOT TREASURES**\n\nA Treasure card with the notation \"Usable once only\" is commonly referred to as a \"one-shot\" Treasure. These are typically used during combat to enhance the munchkins or monsters, and can be played from your hand or from the table. While some have other effects, it is crucial to read the card carefully. Discard these cards once the combat is over or their effect is resolved.\n\nImportantly, one-shot Items with a Gold Piece value can be sold for levels, just like other Items.\n\n**OTHER TREASURES**\n\nOther Treasure cards, such as Go Up a Level cards, are not considered Items. Most of these cards specify when they can be played and whether they remain in play or are discarded. A few examples:\n\n- Go Up a Level cards can be played on yourself or any other player at any time, even during combat. Discard them once they are played. Note: You cannot play a Go Up a Level card to give a player the winning level!\n- Hireling can be played at any time, on any turn. However, you cannot give a Hireling an Item to carry while you are in combat.\n\n# Items and Trading\n\nIf you have more than one item, you must sell them or give them to the lowest-level player(s) who can carry them. If any large items are left over, discard them.\n\n## Trading Items\n\nYou can trade items with other players, but not other cards. You can only trade items that are on the table, not the ones in your hand. You can trade at any time, except when you or your trading partner are in combat. In fact, the best time to trade is when it's not your turn.\n\nAny item you receive in a trade must remain in play. You can also give items away without a trade, as a bribe to other players.\n\n## Selling Items for Levels\n\nDuring your turn, except during combat or Running Away, you can discard items worth a total of at least 1,000 Gold Pieces and immediately go up one level.

If you treat it as a monster, its Level is twice the combat bonus, and defeating it grants one Treasure and one level. Monster Enhancers can be played on Steeds being fought as monsters. If you treat it as an Item, you can add it to your hand and use it immediately or keep it for later.", "context": "**Context: CURSES**\n\nDuring the \"Kick Open The Door\" phase, drawing a Curse card face-up affects the player who drew it. However, if acquired through other means like Looting The Room, the Curse card goes into your hand and can be played on any player at any time. Inflicting a Curse on someone just as they think they've defeated a monster can be a lot of fun.\n\nIf a Curse can apply to multiple Items, the victim decides which Item is lost or Cursed. If a Curse applies to something you don't have, ignore it. For example, if you draw \"Lose Your Armor\" and you have no Armor, nothing happens; discard the card.

If a monster card is obtained through any other means, it goes into the player's hand and can be played during their own turn to Look For Trouble or played to join another player's fight with the Wandering Monster card.\n\nEach monster card represents a single monster, even if the name on the card is plural.\n\n**MONSTER ENHANCERS**\n\nCertain cards, called monster enhancers, can either raise or lower the combat strength of individual monsters. These also affect the number of Treasures the monsters are worth. Monster enhancers can be played by any player during any combat.\n\nAll enhancers on a single monster add together. If there are multiple monsters in a combat, the player who plays each enhancer must choose which monster it applies to.\n\nException: Anything that enhances a monster also enhances its Mate. If Ancient, Enraged, and Mate are played on a single monster in any order, you are facing an Ancient Enraged monster and its Ancient Enraged Mate.\n\n**FIGHTING MULTIPLE MONSTERS**\n\nSome cards, such as Wandering Monster, allow your rivals to send other monsters to join the fight. You must defeat their combined combat strengths. Any special abilities, such as forcing you to fight with your Level only, apply to the entire fight. If you have the right cards, you can eliminate one monster from the combat and fight the other(s) normally, but you cannot choose to fight one and Run Away from the other(s). If you eliminate one monster, but then run from the other(s), you don't get any levels or Treasure!\n\nSteeds are a valuable asset to a Munchkin, providing bonuses and enhancing their rider's abilities. These trusty companions can be found in the Door deck and follow normal Item rules. However, no player can possess more than one Steed, unless a Cheat! card is used.\n\nSteeds are considered \"Big\" items, but do not count against the limit of Big items a player can carry. This designation is used to control which Traps and Curses affect them and to prevent Thieves from pocketing them.\n\nThere are specific Items that enhance Steeds, and while Steeds cannot use regular Items, they can use Steed-enhancing Items. Item Enhancers, however, do not affect Steed-enhancing Items.\n\nIn the case of a Steed providing a bonus or penalty to Run Away, this replaces the rider's bonus. For example, an Elf normally has a bonus to Run Away, but if riding the Turtle Steed, they would have a penalty. If a Steed provides a penalty to Run Away, the player may discard the Steed before rolling to flee, avoiding the penalty but sending the card to the discard pile.\n\nA player who draws a face-up Steed may choose to treat it as a monster instead. In this case, its Level is equal to twice the combat bonus at the top of the card, and defeating it grants one Treasure and one level. Monster Enhancers may be played on Steeds being fought as monsters, and they have their normal effects. If a Steed is attacked as a monster, the consequence is \"Lose a level.\"\n\n# Turn Phases\n\nYour turn begins as soon as the previous player's turn ends. Arrange your cards as desired, then proceed to the following phases:\n\n1. **Kick Open The Door**: Draw one card from the Door deck and turn it face up.\n   - If it's a monster, you must fight it. Refer to [Combat](#combat) on page 3.\n   - If the card is a curse, apply it to you immediately (if possible) and discard it (unless it has a persistent effect or you keep the card as a reminder of an upcoming effect).\n   - If you draw any other card, you may either put it in your hand or play it immediately.\n2. **Look For Trouble/Loot The Room**:\n   - If you fought a monster during phase 1, skip this phase and go to phase 3.\n   - If you did NOT draw a monster when you first opened the door, you have two choices:\n     - **Look For Trouble**: Play a monster from your hand and fight it, just as if you had found it when you kicked open the door.\n     - **Loot The Room**: Draw a second card from the Door deck, face down, and place it in your hand.\n3. **Charity**:\n   - If you have more than five cards in your hand, you must play enough cards to get you to five or below.\n   - For example, you can play Curses, sell Items from your hand, or play Items to the table.\n   - If you cannot reduce your hand to five cards, or do not want to, you must give the excess cards to the player with the lowest Level.\n   - If players are tied for lowest, divide the cards as evenly as possible, but it's up to you who gets the bigger set(s) of leftovers.\n   - If YOU are the lowest or tied for lowest, just discard the excess.\n\nAs soon as you are finished with Charity, the next player's turn begins.\n\n# Faster Play Rules\n\nFor a quicker game, add a \"Phase 0\" called \"Listen At The Door\". At the beginning of your turn, before performing any other action, draw a face-down Door card, which you may choose to play or not. Proceed with arranging cards and Kick Open The Door as usual. If you Loot The Room, draw a face-down Treasure, not a Door.\n\nA Curse typically affects its victim immediately (if possible) and is then discarded. However, some Curses have a later game penalty or a continuous effect. Keep these cards until you get rid of the Curse or the penalty takes effect. (Note: Cards kept as reminders cannot be discarded to power Class or Race abilities.)\n\nYou can allow shared victories, where if a player reaches Level 10 in a fight where you are the helper, you also win the game. If someone plays a \"your next combat\" Curse on you while you are in combat, it counts in that combat. The same is true for a \"your next turn\" Curse played during your turn.\n\nMunchkin is designed by Steve Jackson and illustrated by John Kovalic.

You may not look through the discards unless you play a card that allows you to! When a deck runs out, reshuffle its discards.\nIn Play: These are the cards on the table in front of you, showing your Race and Class (if any) and the Items you are carrying.

You cannot alter the status of your Items during combat or while running away.\n\nAny player can carry any Item, except for extra Big items (see below).

Some Items have restrictions, such as the Mace of Sharpness, which can only be wielded by a Cleric.\n\nYou cannot discard Item cards without a reason. You can sell, trade, or gift Items to other players. Additionally, you can discard Items to power certain Class and Race abilities. A Curse or a monster's Bad Stuff may also force you to get rid of an Item.\n\nRegarding Big Items, you can carry any number of Small items, but only one Big one. To switch Big Items, you must sell the first Item, trade it, lose it to a Curse or Bad Stuff, or discard it to power a Class or Race ability."}, {"query": "When can I play a Hireling?", "answer": "At any time.", "result": "You can play a Hireling at any time, even during combat, as long as you have only one Hireling in play at a time.", "context": "**HIRELINGS**\n\nHirelings, Sidekicks, Monks, Minions, Comrades, and Allies are all treated the same for the purposes of these rules. Hirelings can be found in Door decks in some sets, and Treasures in others (in this set, they're Doors). You can play a Hireling at any time, even during combat, as long as you have only one Hireling in play at a time. If you draw a face-up Hireling, you may put it in your hand if you cannot (or don't want to) put it in play. You may discard a Hireling at any time.\n\nA Hireling is not an Item unless it has a price on it. You may only trade Hirelings that have a Gold Piece value.\n\nA Hireling can sacrifice himself for you. If you lose a fight, instead of rolling to run away, you may discard one Hireling and anything he is carrying, and you automatically escape from all monsters in the fight, even if a monster card says escape is impossible. If someone was helping you in the fight, you decide whether that person automatically escapes as well or must roll to escape.\n\nSome Hirelings give you extra Hands, or let you carry an extra Big or Complex item. In this case, the Hireling does not actually have any Items; he merely increases your own abilities. If something happens to the Hireling, your Items are not affected.\n\nOther Hirelings, like the Elf Hireling from this set, can specifically carry and use an Item themselves; in some cases, a Hireling can use an Item you cannot use for yourself. The Items a Hireling carries count for you and are affected by Traps, Curses, and Bad Stuff as though you were carrying them yourself.\n\nIf your Hireling sacrifices himself to save you, any Items he was carrying are lost.\n\nIf your Hireling is killed, you loot the body yourself and keep the Items.\n\n**ONE-SHOT TREASURES**\n\nA \"one-shot\" Treasure card, indicated by the phrase \"Usable once only,\" is typically used to enhance the munchkins or the monsters during combat. These cards can be played from your hand or from the table. Some have other effects, so make sure to read the card carefully. Discard these cards once the combat is over or their effect is resolved.\n\nOne-shot Items with a Gold Piece value can be sold for levels, just like other Items.\n\n**OTHER TREASURES**\n\nOther Treasure cards, such as Go Up a Level cards, are not considered Items.

Go Up a Level cards can be played on yourself or any other player at any time, even during combat. Discard them once they are played.

However, you cannot give a Hireling an Item to carry while you are in combat.\n\n**Steve Jackson Games**\n\nThe penalty for fighting against Dwarves applies to any Munchkin with a Dwarf Hireling. Similarly, any monster with a bonus or penalty against a race, class, or sex applies to the respective Hireling. \n\nBad Stuff does not affect Hirelings unless explicitly mentioned. When determining a monster's actions, ignore the Hireling's race, class, and sex.\n\n**Hirelings and Sex**\n\nPlease refrain from going there. A Hireling's sex is only relevant in the context of monster reactions or if you want to give them a male- or female-only item. The sex of a Hireling is determined by the sex, if any, shown on its card. It should be obvious to even the most inexperienced Munchkin player which Hirelings are male, female, or genderless.\n\nRobots are genderless, even if their card text uses masculine pronouns. Ralph the Wonder Dog used to be male, but after a visit to the vet, we're not sure anymore.\n\nIf you ever want to change the sex of a Hireling, you'll need the Sex Change Potion.\n\n**Hirelings and Cheating**\n\nA Cheat! card can be used to give you an extra Hireling or to let a Hireling carry an item they normally couldn't (though it's more efficient to use the card on yourself). No power, heavenly or otherwise, will allow the Budget Hireling to carry anything.\n\n**Hireling Items**\n\nIf your Hireling sacrifices himself to save you, any items he was carrying are lost.\n\nIf your Hireling is killed, you loot the body yourself and keep the items.\n\nIf your Hireling is taken away by a trap/curse, by bad stuff, or by a change in loyalty, the items go with him!\n\n**Hirelings and Monster Bonuses**\n\nIf, for example, you have the Dwarf Hireling and you face a monster that gets a bonus against Dwarves, it gets the bonus against you unless you discard the Hireling. A monster that has a penalty will have it applied to you if you have a Hireling with the corresponding trait.\n\n**Super Munchkin and Half-Breed**\n\nThese cards can be played whenever it is legal to play a Class or Race, as long as you have an appropriate card (Class for Super Munchkin, Race for Half-Breed) to attach it to.

If you lose a fight, instead of rolling to run away, you may discard one Hireling and anything it is carrying. You automatically escape from all monsters in the fight, even if a monster card says escape is impossible. If someone was helping you in the fight, you decide whether that person automatically escapes as well, or must roll to escape.\n\nSome Hirelings give you extra Hands or let you carry an extra Big or Complex item. In this case, the Hireling does not actually have any Items; it merely increases your own abilities. If something happens to the Hireling, your Items are not affected.\n\nOther Hirelings, like the Elf Hireling from this set, can specifically carry and use an Item themselves; in some cases, a Hireling can use an Item you cannot use for yourself. The Items a Hireling carries count for you and are affected by Traps, Curses, and Bad Stuff as though you were carrying them yourself.\n\nIf your Hireling sacrifices itself to save you, any Items it was carrying are lost.\n\nIf your Hireling is killed, you loot the body yourself and keep the Items.\n\n**ONE-SHOT TREASURES**\n\nA Treasure card that says \"Usable once only\" is often referred to as a \"one-shot\" Treasure. These are typically used during combat to boost the munchkins or the monsters, and can be played from your hand or from the table. While some have other effects, always read the card carefully! Discard these cards as soon as the combat is over or their effect is resolved.\n\nOne-shot Items with a Gold Piece value can be sold for levels, just like other Items.\n\n**OTHER TREASURES**\n\nOther Treasure cards (like Go Up a Level cards) are not Items. Most of these cards specify when they can be played and whether they stay in play or are discarded. A couple of specific examples:\n\n- Go Up a Level cards can be played on yourself or any other player at any time, even during combat. Discard them once they are played. Note: You cannot play a Go Up a Level card to give a player the winning level!\n- Hireling can be played at any time, on any turn. However, you cannot give a Hireling an Item to carry while you are in combat."}, {"query": "When I loot the room, is the door card drawn face up or face down?", "answer": "The door card is drawn face down.", "result": "When you loot the room, you draw a door card face down.", "context": "# Turn Phases\n\nYour turn begins as soon as the previous player's turn ends. When you have arranged your cards as desired, proceed to phase 1.\n\n## Phase 1: Kick Open The Door\n- Draw one card from the Door deck and turn it face up.\n- If it's a monster, you must fight it. Refer to [Combat](#combat) on page 3.\n- If the card is a curse, apply it to you immediately (if possible) and discard it (unless it has a persistent effect or you keep the card as a reminder of an upcoming effect).\n- If you draw any other card, you may either put it in your hand or play it immediately.\n\n## Phase 2: Look For Trouble/Loot The Room\nIf you fought a monster during phase 1, skip this phase and proceed to phase 3. If you did NOT draw a monster when you first opened the door, you have two choices: either Look For Trouble or Loot The Room.\n\n### Look For Trouble\n- Play a monster from your hand and fight it, just as if you had found it when you kicked open the door. Do not play a monster you cannot handle, unless you're sure you can count on getting help (see [Help](#help) on page 4)!\n\n### Loot The Room\n- Draw a second card from the Door deck, face down, and place it in your hand.\n\n## Phase 3: Charity\n- If you have more than five cards in your hand, you must play enough cards to get you to five or below - for instance, you can play Curses, sell Items from your hand, or play Items to the table.\n- If you cannot reduce your hand to five cards or do not want to, you must give the excess cards to the player with the lowest Level. If players are tied for lowest, divide the cards as evenly as possible, but it's up to you who gets the bigger set(s) of leftovers. If YOU are the lowest or tied for lowest, just discard the excess.\n\nAs soon as you are finished with Charity, the next player's turn begins.\n\n**MONSTERS**\n\nDuring the \"Kick Open The Door\" phase, if a monster card is drawn face-up, it immediately attacks the person who drew it. If a monster card is obtained through any other means, it goes into the player's hand and can be played during their turn in the \"Look For Trouble\" phase or played to join another player's fight with the \"Wandering Monster\" card.\n\nEach monster card represents a single monster, even if the name on the card is plural.\n\n**MONSTER ENHANCERS**\n\nCertain cards, called \"monster enhancers,\" can increase or decrease the combat strength of individual monsters. These also affect the number of Treasures the monsters are worth. Monster enhancers can be played by any player during any combat.\n\nAll enhancers on a single monster add together. If there are multiple monsters in a combat, the player who plays each enhancer must choose which monster it applies to.\n\nException: Anything that enhances a monster also enhances its \"Mate.\" If \"Ancient,\" \"Enraged,\" and \"Mate\" are played on a single monster in any order, you are facing an \"Ancient Enraged\" monster and its \"Ancient Enraged Mate.\"\n\n**GOOD LUCK!**\n\n**FIGHTING MULTIPLE MONSTERS**\n\nSome cards, such as \"Wandering Monster,\" allow rivals to send additional monsters to join the fight. You must defeat their combined combat strengths. Any special abilities, such as forcing you to fight with your Level only, apply to the entire fight. If you have the right cards, you can eliminate one monster from the combat and fight the other(s) normally, but you cannot choose to fight one and Run Away from the other(s). If you eliminate one monster, but then run from the other(s), you don't get any levels or Treasure!\n\nContext:\n---\nCURSES\nIf drawn face-up during the Kick Open The Door phase, Curse cards affect the person who drew them. If acquired through other means, such as Looting The Room, Curse cards go into your hand and can be played on any player at any time. Cursing someone right as they think they've defeated a monster can be a lot of fun.\n\nIf a Curse can apply to multiple Items, the victim decides which Item is lost or Cursed. If a Curse applies to something you don't have, ignore it. For example, if you draw Lose Your Armor and you have no Armor, nothing happens; discard the card. (Some Curses have alternate effects, though, so check out More Munchkin!)\n\nVisit [munchkin.game](https://munchkin.game) for news, errata, updates, Q&A, and much more.

Then proceed with arranging cards and Kick Open The Door as usual. If you Loot The Room, draw a face-down Treasure, not a Door.\n\nTypically, a Curse affects its victim immediately (if possible) and is then discarded. However, some Curses have a later penalty or a continuing effect. Keep these cards until you get rid of the Curse or the penalty takes effect. (Cards kept as reminders cannot be discarded to power Class or Race abilities.)\n\nYou can also allow shared victories - if a player reaches Level 10 in a fight where you are the helper, you also win the game. Note that if someone plays a \"your next combat\" Curse on you while you are in combat, it counts in that combat. The same is true for a \"your next turn\" Curse played during your turn.\n\nMunchkin is designed by Steve Jackson, illustrated by John Kovalic, and produced by the following team members:\n\n- President/Editor-in-Chief: Steve Jackson\n- CEO: Philip Reed\n- COO: Susan Bueno\n- CCO: Sam Mitschke\n- Munchkin Line Editor: Andrew Hackard\n- Production Manager: Sabrina Gonzalez\n- Production Artists: Alex Fernandez and Sabrina Gonzalez\n- Project Manager: Darryll Silva\n- Operations Manager: Randy Scheunemann\n- Director of Sales: Ross Jepson\n\nPlaytesters: Steve Brinich, Moe Chapman, Paul Chapman, Alain Dawson, Jessie D. Foster, Russell Godwin, Al Griego, Susan Rati, Kat Robertson, and Monica Stephens.\n\nWe extend our deepest gratitude to the countless munchkins who have played, spread the word, and suggested new cards since the first release of Munchkin. You all have our love and respect, and you continue to amaze us!"}, {"query": "Can I use a card to compel another player to help me in combat if winning that combat would give me the winning level?", "answer": "No. You cannot compel another player to get the winning level.", "result": "No, you cannot use a card to compel another player to help you in combat if winning that combat would give you the winning level, as it would create a win-or-lose situation and the helper could potentially withdraw without penalty.", "context": "In Munchkin, certain cards or abilities enable you to coerce another player to assist you in combat. However, these abilities are ineffective when fighting for the victory. If you make someone help and the fight turns into a win-or-lose situation, they can withdraw without penalty. Conversely, if you willingly aid someone, you cannot leave just because they're about to win the game - so be cautious!\n\n**Seeking Assistance**\n\nIf you are unable to win a combat on your own, you may request help from another player. If they refuse, you can continue asking until someone agrees or everyone has declined. Only one player can assist you, adding their combat strength to yours. Any player can use cards to impact the combat, however!\n\nYou'll likely need to bribe someone to help you. You may offer your helper any items you are currently carrying, or any number of the treasure cards the monster has. If you offer part of the monster's treasure, you must agree on the order in which you or your helper will pick their share. You may also offer to play any cards from your hand that you are legally allowed to, such as \"Go Up a Level\" cards, on your helper.\n\nThe special abilities or vulnerabilities of the monster also apply to your helper, and vice versa. For example, if a Warrior helps you, you will win if your combined total ties that of the monster, and your helper can Berserk and discard cards to add their combat strength (but only once per combat, not once per monster). If you are facing the Wannabe Vampire and a Cleric helps you, they can chase it away automatically. But if you are facing the Drooling Slime and an Elf helps you, the monster's combat strength is increased by 4 (unless you, too, are an Elf and the monster's combat strength has already been increased).\n\nIf someone successfully helps you defeat the monster, discard it, draw treasures (see Rewards, below), and follow any special instructions on the monster card. You level up for each slain monster. Your helper does not go up any levels, unless they are an Elf, in which case they gain one level for each monster slain. You draw the treasure cards, even if it was your helper's special ability that defeated the monster, and distribute them according to the agreement you reached.\n\nInterfering with Combat\n\nThere are several ways to interfere with others' combats, such as:\n\n1. Use a one-shot card: You can assist another player by using a one-shot to strengthen their side, or \"accidentally\" strengthen the monster with it.\n2. Play a monster enhancer: These cards (usually) make a monster stronger and give it more Treasure. You can play these either during your own combats or during someone else's combat.\n3. Add a monster from your hand to join the combat, either with a Wandering Monster card or by using the special Undead rule.\n4. Backstab a player in combat, if you're a Thief.\n5. Curse them, if you have a Curse card.\n\nREWARDS\n\nWhen you kill a monster, you gain one level per monster, unless the monster card states otherwise, and you receive all its Treasure! Each monster has a Treasure number on the bottom of its card. Draw that many Treasures, modified by any monster enhancers played on it.\n\n1. Draw face-down if you killed the monster alone.\n2. Draw face-up, so the whole party can see what you got, if someone helped you, even if they aren't taking any Treasures (Sucker).\n\nIf you defeat a monster by nonlethal means, you do not gain a level and may or may not receive the Treasure, depending on the method.\n\nTreasure cards can be played as soon as you get them, even if you are the helper."}, {"query": "Can I play a Go Up a Level card on another player?", "answer": "Yes.", "result": "Yes, you can play a Go Up a Level card on another player.", "context": "# One-Shot Treasures\nA \"one-shot\" Treasure card, indicated by the phrase \"Usable once only,\" is often used to strengthen munchkins or monsters during combat and can be played from your hand or from the table. Some have other effects, so make sure to read the card carefully. Discard these cards as soon as the combat is over or their effect is resolved.\n\nOne-shot Items with a Gold Piece value can be sold for levels, just like other Items.\n\n# Other Treasures\nOther Treasure cards, such as Go Up a Level cards, are not Items. Most of these cards specify when they can be played and whether they stay in play or are discarded. A few examples:\n\n- Go Up a Level cards can be played on yourself or any other player at any time, even during combat. Discard them once they are played. Note: You cannot play a Go Up a Level card to give a player the winning level!\n- Hireling can be played at any time, on any turn. However, you cannot give a Hireling an Item to carry while you are in combat.\n\nConflicts Between Cards and Rules\n\nThis rulesheet provides the general rules. Many cards introduce special rules, so in most cases when the rulesheet contradicts a card, follow the card. However, disregard any card effect that seems to contradict one of the rules listed below unless the card explicitly states that it supersedes that rule.\n\n1. No card can reduce a player below Level 1, although cards may reduce a player's or a monster's combat strength (p. 3) below Level 1.\n2. You go up a level after combat only if you defeat a monster.\n3. You cannot collect rewards for defeating a monster (e.g., Treasure, levels) in the middle of a combat. You must finish the fight before gaining any rewards.\n4. You must kill a monster to reach Level 10, and you cannot force another player to help you do it.\n\nFor any other disputes, settle them through loud arguments, with the owner of the game having the final say. You could also consult the Munchkin FAQ and errata pages at [munchkin.game](http://munchkin.game) or start a discussion at [forums.sjgames.com/](http://forums.sjgames.com/) (unless it's more fun to argue).\n\nSTEVE JACKSON GAMES\n\nYour Hand: Cards in your hand are not in play. They don't help you, but they can't be taken away except by cards that specifically affect \"your hand.\" At the end of your turn, you may have no more than five cards in your hand (see Charity, p. 2). Cards in play may not be returned to your hand - they must be discarded or traded if you want to get rid of them.\n\n# Munchkin: Item Enhancers\n\nItem Enhancers are a special type of card in Munchkin. These cards can only be played on an Item that you already have in play and cannot be used on their own. Item Enhancers increase the combat bonus of the Item or grant it new abilities. Once played, an Item Enhancer cannot be moved to a different Item.\n\nGame Design by Steve Jackson\nIllustrated by John Kovalic\nGuest Art by Shaenon K.

Once your cards are arranged as desired, proceed to phase 1.\n\n1. Kick Open The Door: Draw one card from the Door deck and turn it face up.\n   - If it's a monster, you must fight it. Refer to Combat on page 3.\n   - If the card is a curse, apply it to you immediately (if it can) and discard it (unless it has a persistent effect or you keep the card as a reminder of an upcoming effect).\n   - If you draw any other card, you may either add it to your hand or play it immediately.\n\n2. Look For Trouble/Loot The Room:\n   - If you fought a monster during phase 1, skip this phase and proceed to phase 3.\n   - If you did NOT draw a monster when you first opened the door, you have two choices: either Look For Trouble or Loot The Room.\n   - Look For Trouble: Play a monster from your hand and fight it, just as if you had found it when you kicked open the door. Do not play a monster you cannot handle, unless you're sure you can count on getting help (see page 4)!\n   - Loot The Room: Draw a second card from the Door deck, face down, and place it in your hand.\n\n3. Charity:\n   - If you have more than five cards in your hand, you must play enough cards to get you to five or below - for instance, you can play Curses, sell Items from your hand, or play Items to the table.\n   - If you cannot reduce your hand to five cards or do not want to, you must give the excess cards to the player with the lowest Level. If players are tied for lowest, divide the cards as evenly as possible, but it's up to you who gets the bigger set(s) of leftovers. If YOU are the lowest or tied for lowest, just discard the excess.\n\nAs soon as you are finished with Charity, the next player's turn begins.\n\nInterfering with Combat\n\nThere are several ways to interfere with other players' combats, including:\n\n1.

You can also purchase levels by selling items (see Items), but you can never lose more than one level. Your combat strength, however, can be negative if you are cursed or suffer other penalties.\n\nClass: Characters can be Warriors, Wizards, Thieves, or Clerics. If you have no Class card in front of you, you have no class. If you have no Race card in front of you, you are human.\n\nEach Class has unique abilities, as indicated on the cards.

If you have no Race card in front of you, you are human.\n\n**ITEMS**\n\nMost Treasures in Munchkin are classified as Items. Items have a Gold Piece value. A \"No Value\" card is equivalent to zero Gold Pieces and is considered an Item.\n\nAll Items you possess are considered \"carried.\" Items that are providing you with a bonus are \"equipped.\" To indicate un-equipped Items, turn the cards sideways. You cannot alter the status of your Items during combat or while running away.\n\nAny player can carry any Item (except for extra Big items; see below), but you may equip only one Headgear, one suit of Armor, one pair of Footgear, and two \"I Hand\" Items (or one \"2 Hands\" Item) . . . unless you have a card that allows you to ignore these limits, such as Hireling or Cheat!, or unless one of the cards states otherwise. If you are carrying two Headgear cards, for instance, you can equip only one at a time.\n\nSimilarly, some Items have restrictions: for example, the Mace of Sharpness can only be wielded by a Cleric. Its bonus only counts for someone who is, at the moment, a Cleric.\n\nYou cannot discard Item cards arbitrarily. You may sell Items for a level, trade Items with other players, or give an Item to another player who wants it (see below). You may discard Items to power certain Class and Race abilities. And a Curse or a monster's Bad Stuff (see p. 5) may force you to get rid of something!\n\n**Big Items:** You may carry any number of Small items, but only one Big one. (Any item not marked Big is considered Small.) You may not discard one Big item to play another; you must sell the first Item, trade it, lose it to a Curse or Bad Stuff, or discard it to power a Class or Race ability.\n\n**Super Munchkin and Half-Breed**\n\nThese cards can be played whenever it is legal to play a Class or Race card, as long as you have an appropriate card (Class for Super Munchkin, Race for Half-Breed) to attach it to. You cannot have more than one of the same Class or Race card in play at once.\n\nIf you play Super Munchkin with one Class, you receive all the advantages of that Class (the ability to equip Class-only Items, monsters with penalties against that Class suffer those penalties), but none of the disadvantages (you can equip Items forbidden to that Class, and monsters do not get bonuses because of your Class). If the Class has an ability that has a cost, however, you must still pay it - you aren't that Super! If you play Super Munchkin while you have two Classes, you have all the normal advantages and disadvantages of both Classes. (All of the above is also true for Half-Breed, just for Races.)"}]
