There are specific Item cards that enhance Steeds, and some Steeds can even increase the number of Big items a player can carry.\n\nRemember, a player who draws a face-up Steed can choose to treat it as a monster instead.

Keep the Steed as a Steed: In this case, the Steed follows the standard Item rules, and any effect that influences an Item can also impact the Steed. If a Steed has a bonus or penalty to Run Away, it replaces the rider's bonus. For example, an Elf typically has a Run Away bonus, but suffers a penalty when riding the Turtle Steed.

Steeds are considered \"Big\" items, but do not count against the number of Big items a player can carry.\n\nStep 5: If a Steed provides a bonus or penalty to Run Away, it replaces the rider's bonus.

In this case, its Level is equal to twice the combat bonus at the top of the card, and defeating it grants one Treasure and one level. Monster Enhancers can be played on the Steed, and if it is defeated, the consequence is \"Lose a level.\"\n2. Keep the Steed as an Item and add it to your hand. You must follow normal Item rules, including the rule that a player cannot have more than one Steed, except by using a Cheat! card. Steeds are considered \"Big\" items, but do not count against the number of Big items a player can carry. If a Steed provides a bonus or penalty to Run Away, it replaces the rider's bonus. A player can discard the Steed before rolling to flee, avoiding the penalty but sending the card to the discard pile."
